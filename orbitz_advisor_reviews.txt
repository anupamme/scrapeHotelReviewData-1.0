The Stanford Court		2014-08-10	4	We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very helpful.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">905 California Street, Nob Hill, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
The Stanford Court		2014-08-08	3	I spent four nights at this hotel at the end of a 14 day trip from Seattle to San Francisco. I had really been looking forward to my stay here. I had spent days researching hotels in the city and decided to pay extra to stay in this hotel, and I must admit I was a bit disappointed. In general, it was a nice hotel with a great location, but it fell short of my expectations, particularly for how much it cost. -newline-  -newline- The room: The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. However, it was much smaller than I'd imagined (the pictures are very deceiving), and the decor and furnishings are rather outdated. -newline-  -newline- Service/Amenities: The maid service was okay, but I was surprised they didn't replace the dirty glasses I used or the ice bucket liner. Cable was not HD quality and there was no safe in the room. There was no ice machine on my floor (7th) so I had to take the elevator down to the 1st floor. There were frequest issues with the elevators, and often only 1 out of 3 was working. -newline-  -newline- Staff: The staff members I interacted with were great, and very friendly--particularly the valets. One in particular remembered me from the first day and welcomed me back every time I saw him. The restaurant staff were good and the concierge was helpful. -newline-  -newline- Location: The location was fantastic! Both the California and Powell line cablecars stop right outside. Many of the muni buses stop within a block or two of the hotel (though be prepared that those are steep uphill blocks). Chinatown and Union Square are within very close walking distance, and the historic "Top of the Mark" (cocktail lounge with a 360 view at the top of the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel) is right next door. -newline-  -newline- All in all, this hotel provided a comfortable night's sleep and a great starting point for my daily excursions around the city. But the size of the room, the elevator troubles and the lackluster decor and maid service did not live up to the 4-star luxury accommodations I anticipated.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">905 California Street, Nob Hill, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

The Stanford Court		2014-07-31	4	First time visiting san fransisco. Was very pleased with this hotel. Check in was great and they allowed us to check in early and even upgraded us to a city view room. Nice clean room and close to everything. Shopping at union square was a ten minute walk and cable car stop right outside front of hotel. Would definitely come back and recommend to others	<span itemprop="streetAddress">905 California Street, Nob Hill, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

The Stanford Court		2014-07-14	4	Very comfortable room, quiet hallways, convenient location. Only complaint was shower area that had a slight mildew odor. I think that is likely due to the prevailing moist air in the area.

The Stanford Court		2014-07-07	4	Had a great experience at Stanford Court, from initial arrival to adding an extra night and staying in the same room. The concierge was helpful with any questions we had. Also all 3 cable car stops are right in front of the hotel which will take you down to fishermans wharf or ghiradelli square or down california street. Only a 3 block walk down to union square as well so excellent location. Only reason for 4 stars was because the hotel did not have a pool or hot tub (we knew this when booking though) which would have been nice after a day of walking or biking the bridge.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">905 California Street, Nob Hill, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
The Stanford Court		2014-07-04	5	My daughter and I stayed here while loooking at colleges. The staff was warm and attentive, and the hotel was beautiful. We loved that we were right next to the Fairmnt and Mark Hopkins hotel, but were paying FAR less for our room. Convenient to so many of the great sites San Francisco has to offer, including being right on the cable car line.

The Stanford Court		2014-06-10	4	This Hotel was in an amazing location but it is on top of a very steep hill. If you are looking for a great workout on your trip this is the PERFECT hotel for you.

The Stanford Court		2014-05-28	4	You can tell the hotel was old and had just been revamped. Loved the hipster yet antique look of the hotel. The beds were so comfy! The bathroom had towel heater racks which was pretty cool. Didn't really work though. Would def stay again. Staff were nice and friendly. Location was great if you're like me and don't mind the excercise. One straight road down and you hit the city centee, on each side is Chinatown and little Saigon. Very good location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">905 California Street, Nob Hill, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

The Stanford Court		2014-05-26	4	The Stanford Court is a true San Francisco experience. The rooms are lovely and well laid out, we had a great view of the Bay and Transamerica Pyramid, and we could dinging of the cable cars down below. However, you do get an unintentional extreme hill work out every time you leave and came back -- those views come at a price! Other pros: close to the delight of Chinatown, the cable car museum, shopping at Union Square, and there are great breakfasts in the lobby restaurant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">905 California Street, Nob Hill, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2014-05-20	5	In the perfect location, close to everything in downtown San Francisco. The pool is very nice, and the gym is small, but effective. The beds in our room was ridiculously comfortable. They have a restaurant downstairs which is glamorous to say the least. They have a $85 Saturday brunch, which is well worth the money. -newline-  -newline- We decided to splurge a little to get this hotel, and it was well worth the money.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2014-05-04	4	The hotel is in a good location and has a very "old, classy SF" feel to it. I've stayed here a couple of times with no issues, but this last time was a bit of a disappointment. There was no TP (only the roll that was there when we go to the room). We could also hear the guests in the next room in the morning. Lastly, the parking situation was a bit confusing-if you valet its a lot more versus parking in the garage (across the street) yourself.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2014-04-24	4	I really like beds and amenities in this hotel. In fact I always stay there when I travel to San Francisco. But what is increasingly annoying is the speed of wifi - I cannot watch any of the netflix of hbogo on Palace's network unless I plug in into ethernet at the desk which is not convenient at all.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>

InterContinental SAN FRANCISCO		2014-08-03	5	We stayed 2 nights after an alaska cruise. The hotel is pretty new for city. We had a high floor which had nice views of the water and our package included access to the club / concierge floor for breakfast. The fitness center was quite nice as well. -newline-  -newline- The only downside is the location is right by the convention center -- on the 'other' side of Market street which gets a little sketchy at night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">888 HOWARD STREET, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>

InterContinental SAN FRANCISCO		2014-07-14	4	The hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff was incredibly helpful with any all requests. The location of the hotel is good in that it allows quick access to the SOMA neighborhood (where it is located) in addition to the Financial District and Union Square. Any other destinations are also easily reachable by cable car, which are only a few blocks away.

Staff was helpful, hotel and room was lovely. valet parking is pricey as per usual, but the hotel valet informed us there was a parking lot behind the hotel that was half the price if we weren't planning to use our car much. Good tip, since we walked and took cabs everywhere for much cheaper. This hotel doesn't offer free wifi if you're here for business. Overall good stay, will stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">888 HOWARD STREET, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>

Sir Francis Drake, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-08-08	5	Welcome from the moment I entered the hotel. Front desk staff cheerful. Housekeeping was superb, and I left a modest tip; she left me a handwritten note thanking me. This classic hotel is steps from so many things to do in San Francisco. The daily one hour wine hour included off the lobby makes it perfect and a great place to make new friends. My meeting was at the Hyatt, but this one block away location was perfect. The elevators are older, but ran pretty well. Room service was also honest on timing and very good.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">450 Powell Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Sir Francis Drake, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-06-21	5	It was my Birthday trip to San Francisco. We were immediately up-grated upon arrival to a bigger room. The staff was super friendly and happy to see us. The concierges gave us many options to explore the city. We booked several tourist destinations with them. Fast and convenient service. -newline- The Hotel is beautiful inside and out. Luxury without being over the top. The Bar is a welcoming feature entering the Hotel, you must stop and have a drink there. the bartenders are the nicest! -newline- The restaurant is pricy - but so worth it. The waiters were so knowledgeable and friendly, making our Dinner experience extra special. -newline- The Starlight Room on the top floor is a MUST SEE! -newline- We had my Birthday up there and it was awesome. Delicious appetizers and drinks serviced by the most friendliest and (most beautiful) waiter/staff in the city. -newline- The location is simply perfect. Everything you need and want to do is right there. Around the corner , up the street or right in front of your nose. -newline- We loved it there and we love the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. We will absolutely return to this great San Francisco Landmark, and to the most accommodating and courteous, professional, excellent service we've ever had. -newline- If you decide to visit them, you are in for a treat!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">450 Powell Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Sir Francis Drake, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-04-22	2	The Drake is a beautiful place with very polite and helpful staff. However, the noise was awful. We were on the third floor and the street noise kept us up all night long. The cable cars along with vehicles and people noises sounded like they were only three feet away. I believe the windows to be the original thin pane glass installed in 1928. We might as well have had them open. I would not recommend. I also wish we had known up front that we would be charged $62.00 per night for parking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">450 Powell Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Sir Francis Drake, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-12-29	3	Our main complaint is that the room felt extremely small. The bathroom was especially difficult to move around in for putting on makeup, etc. -newline- I booked a massage that was disappointing, not the therapist but the hotel seemed overwhelmed with 2 clients at the same time; no room for the massage table in the room and no table available at the correct time. It had to be borrowed from another hotel. It took about half an hour to find a room suitable to set up the table, etc., meanwhile I wandered around the hotel in my pajamas and spa robe. I would have chose not to do that. The concierge service was excellent as was the maid service. I did order an additional blanket when I first got in on Saturday night which never came. I called two days later to request it again. It came quickly this time. The massage therapist was excellent but the whole experience was too costly considering the inconvenience.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">450 Powell Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

We were not greeted as much as the older customers. I would have liked a better located hotel. There were too many cable car rides, which took up lots of precious vacation time. It was a fun experience to ride them, but I think I would have liked something closer to the piers because we went there almost every night. Waiting late at night in the cold for a cable car or street car was not fun.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-03-10	5	The staff at Mark Hopkins was extremely friendly, helpful and professional. The valets greeted myself and my friend in the parking lot immediately, the bell hop safely stored our luggage after checkout (we were in a class all day) people at the front desk were helpful, housekeepers always had a smile and acknowledged us each and every time we saw them in the hall. The food was good also. I don't have any complaints at all and I would highly recommend this place.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-02-20	4	The Mark Hopkins is a San Francisco classic, on Nob Hill, with a great view, very elegant. Our only complaint was that we left shoes to be shined overnight and they rang our doorbell, twice, at 7:00AM rather than just leaving them, as they said they would do.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-01-20	1	Let me start by saying that I've NEVER written a bad review in all my years of traveling the world - including my job producing and directing for The Travel Channel & Discovery. The Intercontinental Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco left me stranded at the waterfront wharf at 11pm at night when I told them I was alone and afraid and needed their help. They refused to call me a cab stating it was against their policy. the hotel refused to call me a cab saying it was against their policy! I told them I was alone at the wharf . The hotel said they couldn't call me a cab but they could give me a number. I said I didn't have a pen to write it down and that it was dark and desolate needed their help and they said, "that's our policy, sorry, call back if you want a cab number" and then hung up on me! I called them back to get number and beg at this point for them to help me by calling a cab for me - a female guest alone and somewhat upset at this point - they rattled off number which I forgot and when I called back - they rattled it off and hung up again.I'm a New Yorker and comfortable in any situation but this was crazy and I want to warn other female guests and have the Intercontinental change their policy. I asked the Fairmont hotel across the street the next day that if a guest called in for a cab from outside location and the concierge was of course they would!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-01-01	5	The Mark Hopkins is truly a first class hotel with all of the first lass perks: views, staff, food, and location.

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-12-26	4	We were pleased with the accommodations and the complimentary access to the Top of the Mark.

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-12-05	5	We arrived and the type of room we chose was not available. The front desk person was kind enough to upgrade us to a corner room in the next grade up. Everyone was wonderful. The only drawback I can even mention is that it's 59.00 to park your car. You might want to make other arrangements. :)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-08-13	3	The Opal has everything you need in a hotel while sightseeing or visiting for a special occasion, conference, etc. (I was there for a combination of a vacation and a family wedding.) It's comfortable, quiet, and clean. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and housekeeping does their job well. It is an older building, and lacks luxury amenities; e.g. there isn't a refrigerator in the room and the selection of free toiletries is limited. But, if you do any research before booking, you should be aware that this is not a luxury experience; it's a practical place to sleep and store your possessions. The continental breakfast is halfway decent if you stick to muffins and coffee, but there are a number of good places in the surrounding blocks to purchase espresso beverages and a more, um, filling repast for your mornings. Although it's not close to any notable attractions, the Opal is ideally located on two of the most useful MUNI bus routes (the 38/38L on Geary and the 47/49 on Van Ness), and not too far a walk from the BART or MUNI metro at Van Ness and Market. It's on the western edge of the Tenderloin, which is a sketchy (but not dangerous) area and fine in the daytime, unless you're a very easily freaked out suburban type. Polk, the north-south street immediately east of Van Ness, has been gentrified to a reasonable degree and sports mini-marts, cafes, restaurants, and bars; the TL also has great Afghan, Indian, and Southeast Asian restaurants. In short, I'd recommend the Opal, if you're not too much of a diva about extraneous amenities.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-08-11	1	Very old, room was small. AC unit had a high pitched steamy squeal (maintenance did quiet it down.) Floor had a steep slope to it. Glad it was only one night. On the plus side, there is a parking garage close by where you can park for $26/day which is cheap in SF.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-08-07	2	The Opal Hotel in San Francisco was not what I am accustomed to. The hotel is older and definitely needs a more modern upgrade. The location was a distance from where the event we came in to town for.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-08-02	3	I was hesitant to book a hotel I hadn't stayed at or knew someone that had in San Francisco. In addition, one that is in the Tenderloin (even if on the edge). -newline-  -newline- But, afterwards I am glad that I tried this hotel. Rooms were nice, lobby was nice and "secured" (see below), and the hotel was quiet even in the Tenderloin. Also in a great location to take Muni or use a ride share (off major streets). -newline-  -newline- Down sides: cleanliness left something to be desired, the "secured" locked door was opened by the front desk without actually speaking to you on the intercom--a feeling of more for show--and the staff at the front desk moves fairly slow so there was a wait to check-in and out.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-08-02	2	booked room on deal last min, was giving smallest room,no fridge, no microwave, elevator was broken.

The Opal San Francisco		2014-08-01	3	We found this hotel late---just a few days prior to arrival---for way less than the surrounding places. The staff was very friendly, and the hotel offered a complimentary wine and cheese sampling the night of our arrival. The amenities are few, but we were there to see the city, not the inside of a hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-07-31	3	Upon first glance in the lobby one is greeted with Stain Glass doors off to the side and a lobby desk that looks like a concession stand from an old Theatre, but then I read the history and discovered it is an old hotel. The room was large, with a nice sitting area, but it could use a face lift. It was clean just worn. So overall an Ok place to stay, but not amazing. -newline- Things to be aware of...housekeeping arrived at 4 pm a little late as we were back and getting ready for the evening. Parking is $40+ a day, steep even from an east coast perspective.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>
The Opal San Francisco		2014-07-29	3	This is a place to sleep, rooms are clean, but is too dated, the floor carpet had multiple stains and it makes look the room a bit nasty. It's really well located, 7 blocks/union square. Personal is awesome specialliy Maria, she is great. Breakfast is free and is good (eggs, beagles, bread, muffins, coffe, yogurt, juices, multiple fruits) also free wi-fi. Personally I think this is a good option.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1050 Van Ness Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>

Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-08-06	4	I stayed in room 1658 at the Hilton on OFarrell this week. Its an interior room facing the pool. Too bad the kids weren't with me this trip. A little noisy out there at 9p but nothing terrible. This is a very busy hotel and I was very glad that Hilton offered me the opportunity to check in early for $25. Totally worth it for me. The only negative to this hotel is the location. Its close to Union Square but its in a rougher part of SF.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">333 O'Farrell Street, PO Box 420868, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-06-29	5	The hotel is quite big. You have that big entrance hall, a Starbucks is just on the left if you enter the hotel. The rooms are in 3 towers. We had a room with 2 king size beds, it was clean and tidy, and staff was helpful and friendly! -newline- The hotel has their own private-"taxis" too, which cost you only 40 dollars from San Francisco International Airport, that's less expensive than normal taxis.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">333 O'Farrell Street, PO Box 420868, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-05-08	4	The hotel was very close to MUNI, but far from the cool neighborhoods. Very clean, staff was fantastic.

Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-04-21	1	Although our room was nice and available at a reasonable rate, the hotel makes up for it by gouging you financially on every other front. From exorbitant wifi fees, to the $10 cup of coffee that was worse than any cup of instant I've ever tasted. Combined with their parking fees, you will easily end up spending more per day on all the miscellaneous stuff than for your nightly rate. -newline-  -newline- Our in room coffee maker was broken and a replacement was not delivered either.

Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-03-31	2	I looked online for a decent amount of time to find an affordable place in a good location. The Hilton seemed to be the best. We were shocked that not much was included in the hotel, or told in advance. No free wifi, parking was outrageously expensive, even as a hotel guest, and room service there was small print of extra expenses; ex; our small pint of icecream came to $18. It was super busy, load, and chaotic. Hard to think of it as a relaxing get away. We enjoyed San Fransisco but wouldn't recommend this hotel!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">333 O'Farrell Street, PO Box 420868, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-03-16	4	Great hotel and service. My only complaint was being placed in a room with a blocked view of a parking garage with cars going in and out all day and night. I asked for another room and the hotelier moved me. It is a lot of money to pay for a view of a parking garage. ..and the noise associated. -newline- Service was excellent room clean.

Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-03-10	2	The lobby was very impressive, very pretty. Other than that, the room was ok. We stayed on the 8th floor and could hear cars honking and other street noises. We weren't high enough to get a view of anything but the building next to us. THEY DO CHARGE FOR PARKING!!! $50 + a 40% tax! I have never heard of that before.... When you pay $200 a night, you shouldn't be charged for parking. That's ridiculous.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">333 O'Farrell Street, PO Box 420868, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-03-08	5	I happen to be a Starbucks morning drinker. Without my latte it is hard. This is one of the pluses of this hotel for me. They have more economical parking across the street for $39 for 24 hours and $25 for $12 hours. The lobby is big for talking with many group areas. -newline-  -newline- I stayed in tower 3. Stay in Tower 1 if you can. Tower 3 has the smaller rooms and small bathroom. No tub just a shower. Not good if you are not alone. I don't care about the view as I just fall asleep with the TV. The room service menu has a variety but not necessarily the best choices but will do. I found out that they will not honor your loyalty points through a 3rd party reservation apparently do to the discounted pricing. For my reasons, I was willing to give up the points for the discounted price. San Francisco is pricey these days and to be able to make many trips there it is worth it to book the packages.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">333 O'Farrell Street, PO Box 420868, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Hilton San Francisco Union Square		2014-02-24	3	This hotel is rated as a 4 star, however, the value for the money is not as high as I would have expected. The room service and food is excellent, but very overpriced. There are no robes provided, and the room was pretty small. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful Overall, the stay was fine, but for the money, I would have expected a little bigger room, and robes.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">333 O'Farrell Street, PO Box 420868, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Argonaut, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-04-19	5	Excellent location for return trip with son (15) and husband (on first trip to sanF). My favourite Kimpton of several - it really is an ideal spot to walk Pier 39, reach Alcatraz Landing (the night tour is truly awesome, we did this instead of day tour this time) and' bike the bridge'. With CityPasses we made the most of all types of transport, the fab De Young and CA Acaedemy of Science. 10 days (due to the long flight from UK) allowed us plenty of time to explore a district each day. The Argonaut has a spacious lobby and v well attended wine reception each day! Waterfront location with the bleachers and beach is a great reading spot when all walked out. Staff are excellent.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">495 Jefferson Street, At Hyde Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>

Because I was in San Francisco for a short weekend trip, I was sad to waste even an hour of the time I had to explore the city. The hotel staff was very accommodating and held onto all my luggage so I could leave the hotel, and offered to bring it up to my room when I got back. I appreciated this so much! -newline-  -newline- Waiting wouldn't have been all that bad, because the lounge area is nice and has self-serve cucumber water.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">495 Jefferson Street, At Hyde Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>

Right when you walk out, Starbucks is 30ft away so you have that just in case you don't want to make coffee in your room. Plus they had purified water on floors 2-8, where they provided you with individual water bottles and a machine for purified water to fill up and bring to your room, which is great for people who absolute need to have cold water in the night. Standard hair dryer I your room but no ironing board and iron, you have to request for those items to be brought to your room. The location is decent, it's by a tom of locations for your to walk to since your in the financial district but they have a few local places around and on Sundays they are mostly closed since it's downtown area. We took a taxi to most if the locations. It's a small 7-10 min walk to little Italy and the other bars so that's a plus but most other places you'll think about taking a cab unless you love walking. Overall the place was great and I would stay again!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">424 Clay Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94111</span>

Club Quarters in San Francisco		2014-04-17	5	Arrived early on Friday and was able to walk to the hotel from the BART station with no problems. We were allowed to check in early, and the staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions. Elevators would only allow access to the floors if you swiped your room card, so the added security was a nice surprise. The room was clean and comfortable. The only problem we encountered was with the AC. We notified the front desk when we left one morning for breakfast, and when we returned we were told the issue had been addressed. The units are eco friendly and only kick on when there is movement in the room, so if you want it to continue to cool through the night you have to turn on the fan. Walls are a little thin and you could hear the alarm in the room next to us in the morning, but not a real issue. We stayed for three nights and were very pleased with everything. The location is wonderful and really within walking distance to just about everything you could want.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">424 Clay Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94111</span>
