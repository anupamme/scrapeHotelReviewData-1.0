Omni Parker House		2014-07-20	5	A hotel with history. Great location. However, prices for in-room food and bar, very expensive. Staff very informative and helpful.

Omni Parker House		2014-07-13	3	This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. Our room this year had a queen bed and was very tiny for our 10 day stay but we made it work. Dominic, who checked us in when we arrived, was amazing. Every staff member we encountered was friendly. The workout room is functional. It is more economical to eat and drink outside of the Omni. The location can't be beat! We did the Freedom Tra Run which started at Boston Common. We went to two Red Sox games, walking both times. We went on a walking chocolate tour starting from Copley square. We also walked to the North End and Quincy Market.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">60 School St, 60 School Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>
Omni Parker House		2014-07-12	3	Decent value. Good location. But a little run down.And its huge size (over 500 rooms) meant impersonal service and very crowded and noisy public spaces. The experience was OK, but a little depressing.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">60 School St, 60 School Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>

Omni Parker House		2014-06-21	4	Stayed in a junior king suite. The room was decent sized although the bathroom was teeny tiny. The bed was fantastic and the room was overall very clean and very quiet. The view left a lot to be desired and had to keep the blinds (no sheers option) shut due to office staff about 12 feet away. That was a bummer, as was my broken TV. Overall though, it was cute in a charming, historical way, which I like. Fans of modern hotels should look elsewhere.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">60 School St, 60 School Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>

Omni Parker House		2014-06-16	4	Excellent hotel ideal location to explore the city, short walk to Boston Common etc. Friendly and helpful staff helped organise my travel to Nantucket Island. In the future it would be helpful to enjoy my stay more if there was a fridge in the bedroom and also if there had been an office/ computer facility within the hotel. Overall a good location, for added value it would be good if breakfast was included as part of the room price.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">60 School St, 60 School Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>
Nine Zero, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-07-11	5	I booked the reservation based on the value, location and nice website appearance. I ended up with so much more. The staff couldn't be any nicer. There was fresh, cold citrus and fruit infused water in the lobby at all times, as well as coffee in the morning and wine in the afternoon. The location was easy to access by car and walking distance to many desired spots. It is also a great place to run, being near Boston Common and the harbor. The fitness center was simple, yet very adequate, refrigerated towels. -newline-  -newline- The room was clean and well decorated, great bathrobes, and convenient internet access once I became a loyalty member. If other Krimpton Hotels are similar, I will look for them when I travel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">90 Tremont Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>

Nine Zero, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-04-23	5	Perfectly situated for marathon and sightseeing. Closest hotel to the busses on race morning. The prettiest about 1.2 mile walk to Expo through the Commons and the Public Gardens, then up Boylston past the Fiinish Line. The hotel is pricey that weekend, but worth it. They put out a small buffet morning of race with foot massages after.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">90 Tremont Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>

Nine Zero, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-02-18	5	We had a great experience at the Nine Zero. The staff was fantastic. Internet access was strong and reliable. The location is perfect for visiting the historic sites, financial district or downtown- nearly everything you want to visit is in walking distance. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was also kid friendly. -newline-  -newline- Our room came with a great view of Boston Commons ( this was an upgrade, but worth it). -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">90 Tremont Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>

Nine Zero, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-12-08	5	The Kimpton line is great and the Nine Zero is a favorite when in Boston. The staff at this location is great - the valets who are always welcoming, Megan Bevis and the other concierge staff who are ready and willing with great service and recommendations and Amy Fell and the front desk staff ready for any request. -newline-  -newline- Great location, nice amenities and decor, but it is the staff that will keep me coming back.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">90 Tremont Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02108</span>
Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-04-10	5	Our son's two favorite things are sports and history, so Boston was a great spring break location. The Onyx was the ideal spot for exploring the city. We walked, used the T and even secured a car for our trip back to the airport, and the Onyx staff was helpful in helping us navigate an unfamiliar city. The location was just blocks from the wonderful restaurants on the North End and several local pubs with excellent Clam Chowder. Right across the street from the TD Garden for the Celtics game, but not far from anything, we will definitely stay at the Onyx again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-03-25	4	Took a chance on booking the Onyx and glad we did. Terrific location (around the corner from the subway), can walk to great restaurants. The hotel and staff were wonderful. We didn't figure out how to get internet until the last night's stay, and the wine hour was great. Will definitely stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-03-24	4	Not a ton of amenities, and a somewhat out of the way location, but close to the North Station T stop and from there the rest of Boston. Rooms are pretty small, but not surprising for a downtown hotel. Still had space at reasonable rates less than two weeks before Anime Boston, when many hotels were pushing up their rates, although it isn't particularly close to the Hynes convention center (although it's on the same T line, which is a flat rate regardless of distance traveled).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-03-03	3	My husband and I stayed on 7th floor of the Onyx. The rooms was small, well decorated, and very clean. The staff was very friendly and pleasant. We were offered us bottles of water for our long trip home. -newline-  -newline- There was a quaint wine reception from 5-6 pm in the hotel lobby and we attended. It was very welcoming and we enjoyed a couple of glasses of free wine! We also had a snack at the Ruby Room which was very tasty. -newline-  -newline- The best thing about this hotel is it's location. It is one block from TD Garden, an easy walk to Quincy market, Nathanial Hall, the New England Aquarium, and tons of restaurants and shops. -newline-  -newline- Another small treat was delicious orange infused and lemon and lime infused water in the lobby at all times. In addition to that, very decadent hot chocolate, tea, and coffee in the lobby for the first half of the day.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-02-24	5	I booked this hotel for my sister's birthday and it was everything we wanted it to be, clean, great staff and close to fanueil which was where we were going out.

We loved the Onyx <3	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>

Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-06-12	4	We needed a place to stay while attending a graduation in Cambridge, and though the Onyx is in Boston, we got there quickly by taxi ($20) from the airport, were close to the T's Green Line and steps away from Boston's historic quarters, all around. The staff was very welcoming and friendly, the room was snug but very comfortable and quiet.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Onyx, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-05-29	3	ok, i will start off with the good first. The staff, a young bunch of recent college grads for the most part, was extemely nice and helpful. they were great!! -newline-  -newline- ok, now for the not so good....parking is a hassle...i guess that's the norm at city hotels though....not in the greatest area of town....good only if you are an out of town fan that is going to TD Garden. the room is very small, but very clean. they up-charge you for everything.....internet, printing something, parking, etc....a bit annoying to me. -newline-  -newline- I would only recommend staying here if you get a great rate.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Portland Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill		2014-07-08	4	Great affordable hotel in a fantastic section of Boston. Easy to get to everything. n The T was just 2 blocks away.

Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill		2013-10-04	4	This hotel was the best price in the area for the week. Even though I prepaid, I was offered a higher floor room wIth a view. Close to many good restaurants, Charles/MGH Red line stop and the river paths. Whole Foods is right there if you get tired of eating in restaurants. Don't like the doorless closet but the room was very clean and quiet - even though the elevator was close by.

Millennium Bostonian Hotel Boston		2014-07-28	5	Fantastic hotel. We had a great experience staying here. The location cannot get any better as it faces the Faneuil Hall and is seconds away from Gov't Center, Boston Garden, North End, Financial District and the T (subway). It's also accessible on foot to Boston Common. -newline-  -newline- It has a nice pull-in for your car, which makes you feel safe from the chaos on the roads of Boston. Once you arrive, it's easy walk to everything. The downstairs restaurant has good food, roomy, full of light, and is a wonderful place to people watch. The room was clean and the staff was very responsive. highly recommended.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">26 North Street   At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02109</span>

Millennium Bostonian Hotel Boston		2014-07-26	4	I loved the location of this hotel, right next to Quincy Market by the Hard Rock Cafe. The room was spacious and the bathroom was amazing. I would have given this a 5 star if the front desk girls cared about us more than their weekend plans and iPhones. However, the morning staff was more than friendly at checkout, I feel like she genuinely cared about how our stay was.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">26 North Street   At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02109</span>
Millennium Bostonian Hotel Boston		2014-07-21	4	We stayed here for two nights. The location was absolutely perfect. We could venture up or down the Freedom Trail from this central location, and being right near Quincy Market allowed us to get a quick bite at a cool landmark whenever we wanted. -newline-  -newline- The outlets in the lamp in our room didn't work so we plugged our phones in across the room instead. We did not alert hotel staff. If we had, I'm sure they would have handled it. We LOVED the walk-in shower that our room had. -newline-  -newline- They room was clean, modern, and comfortable and the staff were not overly accommodating, but efficient and competent. -newline-  -newline- We ordered dessert late one night from room service and it, and the service, was fantastic. The lady who was tending bar was pleasant and whipped me up a Ward 8, which no other bartender in town was knowledgeable enough to do so (which might say more about the other bars we frequented). -newline-  -newline- We will definitely stay here our next visit to Boston both for the price relative to other hotels in that area and because of its AMAZING location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">26 North Street   At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02109</span>
Millennium Bostonian Hotel Boston		2014-07-19	4	I was only here for an overnight on business. You can't beat this hotel for location. It is across the street from Faneuil Hall, next to the farmer's market, and a very short walk to either the North End or the Public Gardens. The State Street T stop is also right around the corner. My only complaint was that I had been given a handicap-accessible room, for for me the bath/shower was just ok, but since it was a short visit I didn't worry about it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">26 North Street   At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02109</span>

Club Quarters in Boston		2014-06-04	3	we paid a lot of money to stay in this hotel.4 people in one room. ok. But it said kitchenette. I do not class a fridge and a microwave oven as a kitchenette. £600 for three nights, no breakfast. not good.Our room was on the 2nd floor next to the ice making machine,water machine and vending machine. Above us was the gym which people seem to use from 6.00am. so you can only imagine the noise. -newline- The hotel is attached to an 'English pub'. Service here was not good and I let them know the day we left.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">161 Devonshire Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>
Club Quarters in Boston		2014-04-26	4	I stayed at this hotel mostly based on price and because it was in the hotel category I was looking for. I had never stayed there before although I've stayed at many other similarly priced hotels in Boston. The location couldn't be beat. The staff was very friendly. The room was very nice but a little dark. The window didn't help with the light because it just looked out at other buildings. Overall, I was very satisfied, and I will definitely stay here again, depending upon price at the time of my next stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">161 Devonshire Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>

Club Quarters in Boston		2014-03-17	4	I stayed here for 2 nights in March 2014 for a business trip. I found the regular room on the small side, especially the shower. I am petite, and I was hitting the wall's and curtain of the stand up shower stall. Also, I don't believe they have king size beds. For one person on a business trip, I think its fine; but if you are a couple on vacation, I would book elsewhere.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">161 Devonshire Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>

Lenox Hotel		2014-07-29	5	Loved the hotel and the location. I want to give a shout out to Nate, the concierge. I've never had better service at a hotel.

Lenox Hotel		2014-06-21	5	We wanted to visit Boston as neither of us had been previously. We chose the Lenox based on reviews and its location in Back Bay. Nothing was too difficult to get to. The staff were excellent at all times and helped us to get the most out of our 6 days in the city. The bottom line says about recommending to a friend - yes, with reservations. The reservation being that I wouldn't want so many of them to book that I can't get a reservation!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">61 Exeter St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02116</span>

Lenox Hotel		2014-04-21	3	Awesome location, the rest is not worth the price. Staff is trying to be helpful, but extremely inexperienced...For example, had my bag stuck to another car that almost left with it when the were "helping" unload my car..

Lenox Hotel		2014-04-17	5	Great hotel in a perfect Back Bay location - near trains, Copley Square, Mapparium, and so much more. The room was super quiet - never heard anyone on either side! The staff was wonderful and couldn't be any more helpful. They thought of everything - including a huge list of things you might have forgotten that they will provide free, from toothpaste to nail polish remover and nail clippers!! Our room even had an umbrella. Loved the restaurant where we enjoyed great breakfasts each morning. Will always return to this hotel whenever I'm in Boston!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">61 Exeter St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02116</span>
Lenox Hotel		2014-04-09	5	Incredible accomodations, location, friendly staff, Room Service, City Table Restaurant. Only negative would be noise level.

Lenox Hotel		2014-04-08	5	Extremely well located for business and leisure. -newline- Staff service is unbeatable. Word NO does not exist there.

Lenox Hotel		2014-04-04	5	The hotel has a very nice boutique touch and the staff there make you feel welcomed as soon as you walk through the door. We had a free upgrade upon arrival and complimentary snack basket is included in the room (love the Kiehl's toiletries btw). The location couldn't be any better (a trip to Newbury St is a must!) and subway station is cross the road from the hotel. The staff are friendly, helpful and professional.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel		2013-12-07	4	Very pleasant time and very comfortable room. Great bed!!!

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel		2013-11-26	5	My boyfriend and I first arrived in the morning on a Thursday and thought we'd have to just beg the hotel front desk to hold our bags, so that we could go out for the day before checking in. However, I approached the desk and informed the clerk that we had arrived and began to ask if she'd be able to hold our bags until check-in time. Instead of just saying "sure," she told us that they had a few rooms with double beds but no king-sized ones. I was thrilled. We're not terrifically picky people and would be perfectly comfortable on a double, so we said sure. I was just happy that we could check in early. -newline-  -newline- All in all, the whole experience was positive. The staff was friendly, the location was near good restaurants, bars, and Harpoon Brewery (if you like beer, go!), and the rooms were very clean. Also, the hotel is located just across the street from the water, so we ended up with a bit of a view. -newline-  -newline- And, when we were there, it wasn't noisy. Something I totally hate is when I can hear everything going on outside of my room. I'm not sure if it was because we just didn't have any obnoxious people around or what, but our stay was pretty quiet. This is not to say that it's a boring type of hotel at all. On the contrary, it's near some really fun, late-night places. For whatever reason, it just wasn't annoyingly loud. -newline-  -newline- Oh! I almost forgot. There is a Starbucks downstairs! I didn't have to roam around the streets looking for coffee...I had it downstairs from my room! If you need your coffee like I do, you'll realize why that was so exciting for me. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in Boston.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">606, Congress Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel		2013-09-19	4	Great hotel! Very clean and very nice staff. If you are looking to be more downtown in the Faniel Hall area or Fenway Park then it's a little bit out of the way (but you can take the subway "T" over there). Overall, a very nice hotel that is a little pricy but it is a 4 star hotel!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">606, Congress Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel		2013-09-10	4	The location of this hotel is fantastic! I had the 11th floor and had the view of the Boston harbor from my window.

Did the Duck boat tour which was a little long for a nine year old boy. Met lots if great people.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel		2013-06-09	5	This is a very up market hotel within easy commuting distance to the Boston 'downtown' area (and "Cheers"!). Consider getting a "Charlie Card" for unrestricted daily commuting on all Boston public transport for $11. The hotel itself has alll the bells and whistles one would expect, including a Business Centre with internet, which makes up for the fact that WiFi in the room has to be paid for. Attentive and helpful staff, and a homely places to stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">606, Congress Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

The Renaissance Waterfront Hotel was a new hotel so as you would guess everything is clean, new, and contemporary. The staff and service were excellent and location was very good. The fitness center was well equipped and very clean. Several excellent restaurants in easy walking distance, cabs readily available, and this newer part of Boston is easy to access with nice views fo the water.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">606, Congress Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston		2014-07-22	4	Hotel location was perfect. Just 20 minute bile ride to center of Boston. Rooms were clean and spacious. The only thing was service was horrible.

Both were, at least, one day closed only for private event during my visit there. -newline- The first day I tried to request a room service meal it was not a menu; so, I had to phoned twice to obtain one. -newline- Finally, one day, exiting the bathroom I had on my window two men cleaning it. It could be my wife exiting nude the bathroom. Those men were doing noise there by two days, impending me to study in my room.

InterContinental BOSTON		2014-07-01	2	My husband and I stayed here for one night. When we got to our room there were two double beds. I called the front desk and requested a king bed. The room we had faced the city and was an ok view. The front desk preceded to tell me that it was the way I booked And I kept telling him I was never given the option to choose. You would think that seeing a couple they would at least ask at the front desk. After some debate the front desk gentlemen told me to wait in the hall and not touch anything in the room. He came up and escorted us to a different room, opened the door and left immediately. When we opened the curtains we were blocked by another building and view of a roof. It was awful. The bed was also not comfortable for a 4 star hotel and the prices they charge. I like the intercontinental brand and have stayed in other locations but this one lacked service all around. Not happy.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">510 ATLANTIC AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>
InterContinental BOSTON		2014-06-30	4	The room was very spacious and clean. The tv was larger than average and a great view. It was located right on the water which was nice.

InterContinental BOSTON		2014-06-23	3	Stayed here over the weekend for 4 days for a business trip. Hotel is very nice, and has that luxurious feel. It's like staying at a Four Seasons, but not really. Amenities are great, the room was fantastic. Really beautiful. I got a waterfront view and the location and views cannot be beat. I really wanted to give this hotel a 5 but the staff/service colored my review. The staff is very cold and doesn't seem to care very much about the clients. I'm pretty easygoing but if you are a hotel of this caliber you must make sure your staff and service is buttoned up. For instance, I got in late, super tired from my flight, and struggling w/ my luggage and the doorman asked me "do you need help with that?" Obviously I do! And isn't that your job anyway to help the clients coming into the hotel and take their luggage? I've just come back from Chicago and stayed at a boutique hotel and their service there is impeccable. The next day, I left for meetings and came back at 3pm and my room still hasn't been cleaned. I called front desk to ask if it will be cleaned and she said yes. 20 minutes later housekeeping knocks and I told her I will leave the room in 15 minutes for another meeting. She gave me attitude and said "so will I. I need to leave in 15 minutes." That was so rude in my opinion. Then they didn't even take out my used coffee cup or replenished my sugar packets and cream, etc. I know these are little things but they matter especially in the early morning when you're rushing to work and need that first cup of coffee. Finally when I was checking out, they told me I had a charge from the bar downstairs when I didn't even visit that bar or ordered any drinks to my room! So annoying! They eventually took my word for it and took out the charge. But it's the little things like that that makes someone's stay frustrating. All in all, I'd recommend for the location, room and amenities but not for the service.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">510 ATLANTIC AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

InterContinental BOSTON		2014-05-01	5	I stayed for one evening at the Intercontinental Boston and loved it. The concierge was so friendly and accomodating during my stay, and the staff from check-in to room service were all exceptionally friendly! The gym was filled with state of the art equipment, and a gorgeous indoor pool. On-site restaurants such as Miel are gorgeous with a great menu. Right across from the Boston Tea Party museum, and within walking distance of most of the sights to see in Boston, the Intercontinental is a luxurious must-stay!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">510 ATLANTIC AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>
InterContinental BOSTON		2014-04-17	4	I stayed at the InterContinental for one night for business and the hotel was beatiful, in a good location, but the service I received was really what would get me to book this hotel again. -newline-  -newline- I ended up coming down with some sort of flu during my stay at the InterContinental, and called down to room service for crackers and ginger ale. The woman that I spoke with was very considerate, and had room service bring up 6-8 glass bottles of ginger ale and crackers in less than 5 minutes. -newline-  -newline- I assumed I would see an additional charge for the $36-$65 added to my bill since the mini bar charged from $6-$8 per bottle of soda...but to my surprise, I was not charged. -newline-  -newline- It's that type of service and consideration of the staff that sets a hotel apart from others. I have recommended this hotel to others staying in Boston and will continue to recommend it due to the service that I received.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">510 ATLANTIC AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

InterContinental BOSTON		2013-07-24	4	The hotel is in the financial district, with great location for business trips and easy access to Faneuil Hall and other tourist locations. The hotel pool needs to be heated, it was a shock that it wasn't. The room was nice, but not as nice as the price would imply. The staff are nice and helpful, but fail to go above and beyond. A very good hotel, charging an excellent hotel price.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">510 ATLANTIC AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

InterContinental BOSTON		2013-06-10	5	This hotel was wonderful! The staff couldn't be more pleasant or accommodating; the room was spacious, spotless and had all the amenities; the restaurant Miel (never got to sample to Sushi Restaurant, much to our dismay# was outstanding; the location is literally 1 block from South Station and coming in by train from NYC made this ideal! It is also located right on the waterfront, so we were able to go for a nice walk along the water after dinner. We will definitely stay here again #and again, and again!)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">510 ATLANTIC AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02210</span>

Hilton Boston Downtown--Faneuil Hall		2014-07-11	4	This Hilton location strikes a nice balance between access and seclusion. It's two blocks from Faneuil Hall and three from the Aquarium and the rest of the waterfront attractions. This makes it an easy walk to either while not having to absorb the constant horns from the tour boats or crowd noise. -newline-  -newline- It's surrounded by bars, coffee shops and restaurants, so there's no problem with finding a spot for food or drink. The hotel staff seems invested in making sure you're doing well and we enjoyed their assistance. -newline-  -newline- The only knock against them, which will not be one for many, was the lack of wired Internet access. We use WiFi just like everyone else, but we also have a wired travel router we use for our business security and we were unable to use that here. For a business hotel in the financial district, I think it's something worth maintaining. -newline-  -newline- Overall, we really enjoyed staying here. They had everything (almost) we needed in the room, and the stay was smooth and pleasant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">89 Broad Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>

Hilton Boston Downtown--Faneuil Hall		2013-07-11	1	Disappointing. Upon check-in we asked for directions to a nearby restaurant and how to get to the fireworks. The young lady said she was new to the area & didn't know. No luck at the information desk as it was empty. The room was a little cramped. The bathroom sink faucet leaked and the drain in the shower didn't work. Great bartender.

Hilton Boston Downtown--Faneuil Hall		2012-02-20	4	My daughter & I stayed here for the second time on our annual birthday weekend in the city. We love the location - easy to walk to restaurants, Fanuel Hall, and the T. Our room was an over-sized accessible corner room. Beds are very comfortable. Concierge was knowledgeable and friendly. We had dinner the 1st night at the hotel (under renovations)- good meal for fixed price, with excellent service. Continental breakfast was comped for birthday - more than adequate - fresh fruit, pastries, and cold cereal. We'll be back.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">89 Broad Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>

Hilton Boston Downtown--Faneuil Hall		2011-07-09	2	JUST NOT UP TO THE STANDARD EXPECTED FOR TOP DOLLAR HOTELS. Leaky taps in the bathroom, the sink plunger did not work, the TV was antiquated and not tuned in, despite requests to be fixed. Very noisy ice machine, like having the builders in! No concierge lounge, front desk manager not very hospitable or sympathetic to my complaints. We also had a theft from the room, resolved by a refund of one nights stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">89 Broad Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>
Hilton Boston Downtown--Faneuil Hall		2011-07-06	3	This hotel was in a good location. It was close to the long wharf and the outdoor market. The hotel itself was just so-so, nothing special. When we first arrived we did not have a refrigerator or the bath robes that were on the site listings. We told the front desk and they were promptly sent up to our room. Our room was very small and cramped. There was no circulation fan in the bathroom so when you took a shower everything was steamed up. When talking to other travelers who were at other hotels, they paid the same price as us and got way more for their money. On a good note,the staff was very friendly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">89 Broad Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>

Hilton Boston Downtown--Faneuil Hall		2011-06-24	2	We visited on one of the hottest and most humid days of the year. Unfortunately their air conditioning was not up to dealing with this. Despite having the thermostat set to it's lowest I couldn't get more than a weak pant out of the AC vent. At breakfast they had a staff change in the middle which resulted in the omelet we ordered taking over 30 minutes to turn up. I had finished my breakfast by the time my girlfriends turned up. The ice machine on my floor was broken. Having raised these issues directly with Hilton they offered a free breakfast if we stay there again, thanks.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">89 Broad Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02110</span>

Hyatt Boston Harbor		2014-04-29	4	Stayed here 5 nights with a friend for a short getaway. Embrace the location across the harbor from central Boston, because it yields lovely views and among the friendliest and most helpful staff I've ever encountered. Does not have every amenity, but is very comfortable. The location is handy for the airport and soundproofing makes it very quiet. There is a frequent free shuttle to the Blue Line and airport.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">101 Harborside Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02128</span>
Hyatt Boston Harbor		2014-04-25	4	My wife and I stayed here for one night during a date night visit to Boston. We enjoyed our visit very much and we will likely stay there again. A few observations: -newline-  -newline- 1) The hotel has a terrific view if you reserve one of the harbor view rooms. You can see Boston Harbor, the downtown skyline and even bunker hill. It might even be better than the hotels in the waterfront, as those show you the harbor, but not the skyline. -newline-  -newline- 2) If you're coming by land, it is a bit hard to get to. Parking is expensive and it takes a while to get there by public transportation. If you arrive at the airport it is a snap though. If you don't get seasick, a very fun option is to take the water taxi, which picks up at several places downtown and ferries you across the harbor to the hotel - $17 pp round trip. -newline-  -newline- 3) The rooms are nice, clean and modern. They are not terribly spacious, but bigger than you might expect from an airport Hyatt. -newline-  -newline- 4) Because of the location, this hotel can be much cheaper (up to $100 less) than comparable hotels on the waterfront. A big plus. -newline-  -newline- 5) The staff were friendly and helpful, though obviously this will depend on who is working at any given moment. -newline-  -newline- 6) We didn't have a problem with noise, but since it is so close to the airport, that could be an issue for some travelers.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">101 Harborside Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02128</span>
Hyatt Boston Harbor		2014-04-15	3	First I would like to say that EVERYONE was friendly and helpful! Stayed here for first time before an early flight the next morning. -newline- What I found the biggest problem is the age of the furniture, everywhere. In the room everything was scuffed. The leather ottomans were very tired as well as several marks on the black furniture in the room. -newline- The lounge downstairs even had the same problem. The Hi-backed chairs were also tired and worn as well as a large table there. Doesn't management notice this?	<span itemprop="streetAddress">101 Harborside Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02128</span>

Holiday Inn Express & Suites BOSTON GARDEN		2014-04-13	4	We got to the hotel straight from the airport on Sat. afternoon a few hours before check-in. This wonderful girl I wish I would've gotten her name had our room ready within minutes. Lizbeth from housekeeping came everyday to clean and change towels. The hotel sits across from the TD Gardens and right next to several bars. So after a Bruins or Celtics game expect a loud party late into the night. This wasn't a problem for my husband and I. The hotel is also very close to the North Station where you can take the train anywhere you need to go. We went to Fenway for a game and the Boylston Fire Station. We walked to the Science museum for the Duck tours then went back the next day for the omni. This hotel will be where we will be staying from now on. Oh an in the mornings expect to be awakened by seagulls instead of roosters like we do back home!

Holiday Inn Express & Suites BOSTON GARDEN		2014-02-25	5	We were here for a weekend and it was a great time. The room was impeccable, it was close to the gahdin, train line and other fun stuff.

Holiday Inn Express & Suites BOSTON GARDEN		2014-01-01	3	The hotel was hard to find, even though Friend St. is only a couple short blocks. Lots of one way streets and alleys that are hard to maneuver. I called the hotel to ask how to get there. Even though I was only 2 blocks away, the front desk clerk, reading a map, did not seem to know her way around Boston and it took another clerk and 15-20 minutes to help us drive around in circles (during rush hour) to get back to the hotel. The room was well appointed with a small fridge, microwave, coffee maker (1 cup, should be 2), sink, cabinets with paper plates, etc. Room was big enough for 2 adults and 3 children (sofa bed & 2 doubles, desk & huge closet) but was still a little small to get around. We found 3 toys in the room, so it was apparently not cleaned very well. Coffee in the lobby was not very tasty.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">280 FRIEND STREET, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>

Wehad to ask for wash cloths and they were brought up.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">280 FRIEND STREET, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>
Holiday Inn Express & Suites BOSTON GARDEN		2012-05-21	1	We were not looking for luxury, but we were surprised to find that the hotel is located in an unexpectedly seedy area of Boston. Entering and leaving the hotel, drunks and panhandlers are there to greet you. From our room there was a "view" of the blank wall of the Boston Gardens stadium. Past the drunks it was a fifteen minute walk to Long Wharf. Granted the free breakfast was good and the room was clean. Even so, the price for the room was much higher -- perhaps double -- what one would expect for this type of accommodation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">280 FRIEND STREET, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BOSTON</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02114</span>

The Boston Park Plaza Towers		2013-09-23	3	The room is very small and the bathroom is terribly tight to move around. The room needs renovation and the furniture is very old. The room finish is archaic and needs renovation. The carpet is old and needs to be refreshed. For all this money, where is the closet? -newline- I consider this hotel is the worst value for the money. The only positive thing about this hotel is its location and free breakfast.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">54 Columbus Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02116</span>
The Boston Park Plaza Towers		2013-08-25	3	This old hotel has charm. The rooms and bathrooms are small but adequate. The location is great and the amenities for the 15th floor are nice.

The Boston Park Plaza Towers		2013-05-21	3	Overall, I liked this hotel but it is clearly old and a little tired. My room was a decent size, but the bathroom was tiny and, quite honestly, smelled. Right when I got there, I opened the window due to subtle but gross smell of bacteria. It turned out it was the toilet. The lobby is tired. Still, my room was up to date and free wireless was nice. They also gave me a complimentary breakfast. I would stay there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">54 Columbus Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02116</span>

The Boston Park Plaza Towers		2012-09-10	1	Hotel is in a good location for the price however I was VERY dissapointed in the overall experience. The elevators were jam packed and then the doors would close on you when getting out. Some guests had to wait 20 mins to get to the lobby. The walls are paper thin in the rooms. Rooms are generally clean but old (aside from bathroom renovation) and are not impressive what so ever. The from desk employees were helpful but they were serverly understaffed for a Saturday. I recommend paying an extra $50-80 to stay in a better run / more modern hotel. Wish I had!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">54 Columbus Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02116</span>
Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-07-27	3	I stayed here for business, and for the most part, things were passable. For a highly-rated hotel, there were definitely a few things that were annoying: the cold water wasn't actually cold (room temperature at best), Wi-Fi was expensive and relatively slow (roughly $15/day for 3-4 mbps for "premium" internet access), and the room cleaning was pretty inconsistent - sometimes the garbage was emptied, sometimes it wasn't, and once the things I threw out (some paper cups and a plastic bag) were simply placed on the floor, and the towel levels fluctuated daily. -newline-  -newline- Other than that, everything seemed reasonable. Fine bed, otherwise clean room, power outlets anywhere you might want them, a decent restaurant, and so on. Not a bad hotel, but I may try another the next time I'm in the area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">575 Memorial Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">CAMBRIDGE</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02139</span>
Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-07-21	2	Some of the staff were very friendly and helpful. When I mentioned the rats to one, she went to some trouble to help me with transportation. She even waived a $2 charge for a bottle of water. -newline-  -newline- The building is dingy but the room was comfortable if not especially clean. Terrific view. Location, apart from the view, is awkward because it is far from any businesses, restaurants, stores, etc. They do have a shuttle that is supposed to run every 10 minutes. It doesn't. You have to call the hotel to get the shuttle to pick you up, and twice they didn't come and I had to take a taxi. The hotel did reimburse me for the taxi. They also refused to take anyone anywhere but Fenway when there was a ball game on. -newline-  -newline- I was given early check in and late check out - this was a big help. -newline-  -newline- The courtyard is nice enough, but the rats are numerous and bold. One ran over my foot. In two days I actually recognized individual rats. Had I stayed any longer I would have given them names! -newline-  -newline- One shuttle driver would not take people where they wanted to go because his shift was almost over. The other one warned me that there were busloads of 'Asian tourists' and to watch out for them. I was shocked at this. -newline-  -newline- I would not stay here again. It is overpriced for the lack of value, and they nickel and dime you to death. It certainly falls far below the standard you expect from a Hyatt Regency.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">575 Memorial Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">CAMBRIDGE</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02139</span>
Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-07-19	4	The Hyatt Regency is centrally located and is within easy walking distance to MIT, Harvard and Boston University. Yet it's far enough away from all the hub-bub so that it doesn't feel as if it's in the middle of a cacophony of city sounds.

Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-05-26	4	Fancy & big, as you might expect, with a giant atrium & plenty of amenities. The restaurant that overlooks the Charles.

Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-04-17	3	Nice facilities but was just OK overall. The hotel is a long walk to the T stops. They have a shuttle that will take you to the closest stops, but it is not always reliable and waiting for it wasted a lot of time. So - if you need to get places quickly factor in cab fare for your trip. Also, it was surprising to me that there was no coffee available in the AM in the common areas... free or otherwise. I got some in the restaurant but the staff seemed annoyed with me asking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">575 Memorial Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">CAMBRIDGE</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02139</span>
Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-04-14	4	We had a wonderful two day stay at the Hyatt Regency in Cambridge, MA. The rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable. The entire hotel was very clean and comfortable. We used the pool and gym facilities which were far above average. We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful, which, coming from New York, pleasantly surprised us. We also took advantage of the restaurant on the premises and were satisfied with the meals provided. However, one of the reasons we ate at the hotel was because the location is a little bit out of the way, requiring a drive or shuttle bus lift to get anywhere in the city of Cambridge or Boston. That being said, the shuttle van was available, which was a positive. I would stay at this hotel again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">575 Memorial Dr, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">CAMBRIDGE</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02139</span>

Hyatt Regency Cambridge		2014-01-21	2	When I booked this hotel, It stated it was a double room overlooking the river. Upon checking in, I was told I would have to pay an extra $30 to get a room overlooking the river. The man checking us in was rude, and acted like we didn't belong in such a nice hotel. He told us abruptly that the pool was closed, but that we could use the pool in a different hotel, if the shuttle bus had time to take us there, as there were other guests needing the service that would take priority. In all, it just wasn't a great experience. Most of the staff seemed miserable and didn't communicate at all.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-12-31	4	Sheraton West End is conveniently located near a large shopping mall so we were able to escape from the weather when needed. Gift shop inside is very expensive but has all the necessities including snacks and toiletries. The concierge on check-in was not particularly pleasant or helpful, but most of the staff were friendly. We wanted to leave our bags for a few hours on day of check-out but waited 15 minutes at the bell captain's desk and no one ever showed up. There were a lot of people waiting, so we ended up carrying our bags around town. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable with a nice view of the city. The bed was comfortable and sheets were crisp and clean.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-12-22	4	The room was nice but our parking was not validated.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-10-14	4	Stayed with my daughter. Connects to the mall at the Pru, so 70 shops/food at your reach off the second floor. Breakfast at hotel is overpriced, but typical for the city. Restaurant in hotel closes early, so connected to mall is a welcome addition, great place to stay for the money!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-10-02	4	Everything was good. Would suggest they do something about their towels.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-09-16	4	The Sheraton Boston is a very comfortable hotel with a wonderful location. We did not need to rent a car, as it was a 5 minute walk to 2 subway stations, and Boston is a great city to walk in. We were a few minutes from Newbury Street and 10-15 minutes from Copley Square. We were able to walk to and from Fenway Park in under 30 minutes, and thus bypassed traffic and crowded subway cars after a Red Sox game. We loved that the hotel is connected to the Prudential Center and its restaurants, food court, and shops. The hotel also has its own Starbucks in the lobby, which was perfect for early morning breakfasts. Our room was very comfortable and clean, and the hotel staff was pleasant. Although a bit pricey, we would choose to stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-09-15	4	A good hotel in an excellent location. Room was on a high floor with good views over the river.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-09-10	4	Excellent hotel, great location, considering is was the busy long (Boston College moving in weekend), hotel was very busy, and check in very long.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-09-09	4	This hotel was very good. We really approved of their green policy and welcomed the rewards facility for guests who did not want their towels replaced every day. However the system was over complicated and meant that nothing in the room was replenished or cleaned. Also it was not made clear how the rewards tokens were issued or how they could be used. This may sound churlish when every thing else was very good.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-09-06	5	This hotel located in a PERFECT location of Fenway/Copley/Back Bay of Boston has recently had a facelift and every dollar spent was worth it. We were celebrating an anniversary and the hotel with its fantastic view of the city and close proximity to shopping and restaurants was perfect. We would do it all over again and hope to very soon. We recommend the Sheraton without a doubt.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-09-04	3	It was good in the hotel, it's cleaned. The only problem is there is no soap , shampoo and conditioner on the next day? Not only in the second night but on our succeeding nights. We only leave notice don't forget to refill shampoo n conditioner . And also no refill for the taZo tea but its alright . Hoping next time they won't forget those basic needs and hoping they will include toothpaste so that its nir burden for the travelers during check in specially if we only bring one hand carry on baggage that no need to check in but need to inspect what ever liquid we have . And the parking is unbelievable sooo expensive. Thanks you but over all that's was good	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-08-26	3	Nice place, efficient staff. We were on the 20th floor and the elevators were a running joke amongst all guests. In all seriousness, it was not funny. Elevators were always over filled and guests were stuck waiting as elevator after elevator passed by full. Very frustrating. So much so that we started taking the express to floor 26 and walking stairs down to floor 20.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-08-19	3	The rooms was nice, but the bed was horrible. There was nothing extra like breakfast or parking included so I wouldn't say it was perfect.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-08-12	4	The location was perfect: went to a concert at Fenway, shopped along Newbury Street, had a great brunch in the South End, and ran along the Charles without needing a car.

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-08-12	5	Everything was perfect. It wasn't cheap but so what? We got a great view of the Christian Scientist pool and fountain from the 28th floor. We walked through the hotel and went through the mall to our kid's apartment without having to get wet. Everybody was friendly and helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-07-29	4	We just spent our weekend at the Sheraton. The location is great, you can walk to almost all the turistic locations in Boston. The from was great, I payed more for an ad grade, it was in a corner with two big windows, one facing Cambridge. The bathroom was very small, and a little bit out.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-07-21	4	The location of this hotel was awesome since we were going to a Red Sox game at Fenway. The concierge even provided us with written walking directions when we asked how to get there - very impressive. We were upgraded to a king suite which was very nice, but the air conditioning was on very low and it had been a hot day which meant that it never sufficiently cooled the whole space. The bedroom ended up being only slightly warm, while the extra space where the AC was located was freezing. We also struggled to figure out parking - two different receptionists and the valet were unable to give us adequate information as to where was a safe (untowable) place to leave our car over night. Overall, we were only there for about 10 hours overnight, some of which we were at the baseball game. It was a good enough room.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-07-16	5	Wow! This is a marvelous hotel with everything you could possibly need. Since hotel parking was very expensive, I chose to do without a vehicle and getting around the city could not have been easier. The hotel is situated close to bus and subway transportation that will take you anywhere you might wish to go. Being so nicely located, put me in the center of great restaurants, shopping, entertainment and many historical sites. The room was smallish, but quite ample and very clean and comfortable. The bed with its nice comforter and pillows afforded a most restful sleep. The hotel made my trip to Boston perfect.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-06-17	4	Hotel was in a great location. It was easy to get around and close to all the things we wanted to do...Fenway, shopping, dining, etc. Hotel staff was great. Room could have been cleaner. 4-star hotels shouldn't have ripped lamp shades and pieces of trash under the bed!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-06-17	3	Check-in was fast and accurate. I appreciated that being a tourist from out of town. Additionally I was able to check in right away, which was excellent because I arrived much earlier than the scheduled check-in time. However, it was expensive for what it was. Fortunately I got a deal, but if I paid regular price for the experience, it would have been even more disappointing. There was also a stain on the sheet which just should have not been overlooked when making the bed, and the bathroom sink was cracked pretty bad, with peeling in the shower. Only staying for one night, it was what it was, and again, for the price of the deal, it met expectations, but full price, it would have been very disappointing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-05-25	4	This hotel was great, excellent location for the conference I attended. The staff were wonderful, very attentive and helpful.

But even then the staff brought out free water to everyone.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-04-29	4	I didn't know what to expect since I had never stayed in this area of Boston. The hotel is part of a self-contained mall/transit stop/hotel complex/even a chapel! -newline-  -newline- We took the T (subway) all over the city from this starting point. -newline-  -newline- There are wonderful restaurants, shops, and sites to see nearby.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-04-01	4	Found my room on a hotel finding/price comparison website. Compared to the other hotels in the area as last minute it was... I got my money's worth for the price AND THEN SOME! Front desk staff was very friendly n it was like she already knew me having lived in the same town as me and of the number of places she worked also knew the town where my friend grew up as well. Got to the room, gorgeous. Very clean and pristine even having been in a handful of other hotel rooms before. Decent view and all around great deal for the price. Definitely would recommend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-03-26	4	I arrived at check-in time (3pm). However, the room I had reserved was not ready yet, which I discovered when I entered it with my room key and discovered the bed unmade, etc. I went back to the front desk and was given another room (with a better view) immediately. -newline- The hotel is expensive, but not much more/less expensive than other hotels so centrally located in Boston.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2013-03-18	3	The location of the Sheraton is amazing. right in the heart of Back Bay. It is centrally located and next to all the food and shopping you need. That was pretty much the only amazing thing about it. -newline-  -newline- The room was clean and it had new furniture but the bathroom was old and dingy. My wife found a dirty towel and when I called to ask for more, they never came. Service was average and the hotel was really crowded. I would stay here in the future only if I had a really good deal, otherwise i will book and another hotel in the area, even if it costs and extra $30-$40 a night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2012-08-25	4	Besides being a 4-star hotel, the Sheraton is in a great location if you plan to walk to most everything you will be doing in Boston. Some places still require a taxi or the "T," but we walked to Fenway Park and to Fanneil Hall and the Harbor and every where in between. Would recommend for everyone from anyone travelling for business or a family on vacation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2012-08-25	3	Good stuff: Location, location, location. Couldn't be better. Easy access to everything. Also friendly staff, particularly the woman who manages the valet parking and such, Kate. She was an encyclopedia of information about everything Boston, and Boston is a wonderful city. -newline-  -newline- Bad news: Parking. Outrageous cost. We found a parking lot across the street for "only" $29/night. You couldn't take the car in and out, but you really, really, really don't want to drive in Boston anyway. Not only is the traffic awful but the mantra is apparently "You can't get there from here." Taxis are a bit expensive too. The "T" metro is the best option, although again, at $2.50 a ride, one-way, it's expensive for a subway. Get a multi-use card, by all means. There's also a break for seniors, but you have to go somewhere and show proof of age to get a senior card; you can't do it at the machines in the stations. -newline-  -newline- As to the hotel, it was ordinary. Smallish room. A bit worn around the edges. Three of the four South Tower elevators were out of service, which makes for a real problem in the morning when everyone's trying to get out. Not a four star property; more like three. Not good value, at five start prices.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>

Sheraton Boston Hotel		2012-08-12	3	The hotel was ridiculously crowded on our day of arrival, and for the next 2 days. Friday and Saturday were better.

The location is by far the best thing about this hotel, all else average.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">39 Dalton Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Boston</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">MA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">02199</span>
Sheraton Boston Hotel		2012-05-30	4	We loved the location, central to everything and able to walk most places. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff very nice.
