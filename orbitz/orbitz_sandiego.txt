Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2014-07-18	4	As usual, the Embassy Suites puts on a good show. When you include the managers reception and the breakfast, this hotel is worth the money if you are in need of a suite. On this trip there were three guys, all who needed a separate bed. I ended up on the couch and enjoyed it. The front desk delivered a comforter and I slept comfortably on the couch. My friends said the beds were comfy also. -newline-  -newline- PRO's- Location on the bay, Walking distance to Seaport Village and the Midway museum, good service, free alcohol in the evening, free full breakfast (even made to order omelets if you desire), and a combination Baskin Robbins and Dunkin Donuts attached to the hotel. -newline-  -newline- CON's- Street parking is almost non-existent, Hotel Valet Parking is $40 a night (it does have in and out privileges, but there is also a customary tip each time you retrieve and park.)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2014-06-03	3	The hotel was very nice. Location was fabulous. Restaurants were in walking distance and the Comfort level was high! I will definitely consider staying there again! Only down fall is parking costs $35.00 per night.....   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2014-05-07	5	We had a wonderful experience. It is a great location for walking to local destinations: Gaslamp, shopping, Ferry ride to Coronado and Sea Port Village. Nice breakfast and happy hour. I wish it had free internet and parking included.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2014-04-27	5	I stayed at the embassy suites for 4 nights for a business trip. The hotel and room upkeep were great. The additional amenities of breakfast and happy hour were great bonuses. What I thought really put the finishing touches on the stay was the staff. Very courteous and friendly and willing to help when needed. -newline- The only downside to the hotel is lack of free wifi in rooms. You can get free wifi in the large lobby where thre are plenty of places to sit, but in the room would have been nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2014-04-16	5	Great location, friendly and helpful staff, great amenities. Evening reception with complimentary drinks is a great perk when just arriving from out if town. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was good, great offerings and took away the time of having to find or drive somewhere for breakfast. -newline-  -newline- Only drawback was the $39 fee for valet. Found this to be a little outrageous.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2014-03-10	4	the hotel was clean, room was clean. We were in a room above the kitchen and got the bacon smell at 4am, but that was the only demerit.

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2013-12-08	3	We ended up booking a second room for our son and his family . They were in room 827 and the noise from above and around them was horrible 3 out of the 4 nights. They even called down to desk to request a different room. The request was not honored . For the cost of the room this was very disappointing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2013-09-09	4	We love the managers reception and free breakfast. Its close to Seaport Village and the harbor. Great view of the city and bay.

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2013-08-26	4	This hotel was a great pick for my kids and me. Very well located with easy access to everything via car, public transportation and walking. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. They were engaged and enjoying their roles. Slow drain in the shower and $35/night parking fee were the only two disappointments. However, I would stay here again due to the overall experience here and the great location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2013-08-26	3	The hotel is nice and the location is great for what we needed. The breakfast buffet was a mob scene. Does everyone in San Diego come here to eat breakfast? The other disappointing thing is who are the special people that get to stay in higher floors? I called the hotel to request after booking through an online booking company. The hotel said the online booking company had to request it, which they did on my behalf. At check in, we were put on the 4th floor of a 12 or so story hotel and told there weren't any higher available. Dropping $1,600 for six nights should get us better than that.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2013-08-05	4	The hotel is in a great location and very comfortable, The valet area is smalll and we had to wait every time we came or went with our car.

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2012-01-07	4	Iloved everything about this hotel, especially the room(s), but you pay extra to park, wifi, and it starts to add up.

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2011-11-28	4	Dislikes first, Stayed twice. One time rented car, second, took cab. As close as it is to the airport they should have an airport shuttle. However, a cab ride is about $16.00 plus tip which is a good price. I've paid more than that for hotel shuttles at other hotels so it's not a huge complaint. -newline-  -newline- My biggest gripe was $30 for overnight parking. I've never seen a rate nearly that high at any other hotel. It's a rip-off. I parked overnight on the street for free a block from the hotel. I will never pay $30!!! -newline-  -newline- Things we liked. Great room, staff very helpful and courteous. My family loves the full breakfast. The location is excellent.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2011-10-20	4	Paid extra for the bayview room with a balcony but when I got there the told me they didn't have any balcony rooms available. The desk clerk told that someone had "decided to stay an extra day" and they couldn't move them out. They did not offer any kind of compensation for the trouble. That was disappointing, but the rooms were nice and the morning free breakfast was good.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2011-10-18	4	Location... location... location... it's not just for the purchase of a home but also for vacation stays. Embassy is located next to public transportation (lightrail & buses) as well as walking distance to many vacation sites. My wife and I enjoyed the inclusive happy hour and our children enjoyed creating their own breakfast at the made-to-order omelet bar (also inclusive). My son had many place to ride his skateboard which made him not want to leave.

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2011-08-22	4	Our only issue was that checkin was at 4:00 pm.. We got there after 5.. We were checked in to our room and when we get to our room the door is open and the cleaning lady was still cleaning. It wasn't her fault and she was confused at how we were checked in when she hadn't released the room as being ready yet. So that was a little awkward being in the room while she finished her cleaning. Other than that it was great.. And the complimentary buffet was great too! -newline-  -newline- It's a little far for walking to Gas Lamp.. Especially in heels. Will most likely pick another hotel if were going there for that reason.

Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown		2011-08-12	3	My wife and I have been coming to this hotel every August for seven or eight years for an annual convention, and every year we we grow increasingly frustrated by the management's predatory attitude toward their customers. Reservations are non-refundable. Everything is an expensive add-on: overnight parking, internet access, it all costs extra. Services are poor: we had to stand in line 25 to 30 minutes for the breakfast., and several items had run out when we got to the serving area. Several years ago the excellent in-house restaurant closed; it has yet to reopen. This year, the hotel refused to give us Hilton Honors points because we made the reservation through Orbitz rather than their own web site--regardless of the fact that the Embassy's web site said there were no rooms available but Orbitz offered several rooms at a variety of prices. We're done with Embassy--we'll pick a different hotel next year.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">601 Pacific Highway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

The free breakfast was awesome but we had to stand in a long line for an hour to get it. Well if you love kids and long lines and crowded pool (including almost everywhere in hotel), you gonna love the place. Our other problem was the train station which was too close and it's horn was so laud (it continued every hour till 1:00 am.). I loved the interior design and the rooms.

It was within walking distance to the Gaslamp District and Fisherman's Village, which was ideal.  There's unlimited free cocktails from 5:30PM-7:30PM and a free hot breakfast buffet.  These are pluses, but the parking is $25 a night and the room is fairly pricey.  Good for families, but uninspiring for others.

It offers the ability to walk to the sights along the bayside and marina area.  The hotel  lobby area was very nice. The breakfast area seemed a bit dated. The buffet breakfast food was always cold, so opt for something from the griddle. The food service staff were the nicest people at the hotel. The concierge was less than genuinely friendly, however she delivered accurate information on getting to La Jolla and Coronado Island (must see). The recommended car rental at the hotel was outstanding, but stand by for the steep valet charges.  My room had older furniture and the vanity in the bathroom doubled as the AC intake, and was in dire need of replacement.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2014-03-31	4	I was at the bahia for both business and pleasure. I had a room on the fourth floor in the building by the bay and the view was excellent. My room was clean, pleasant, and comfortable. The staff were very courtious, and besides a little slow service in the cafe at times, there is not much to complain about. My family and i went out on the bahia Belle one night and had a great time. There was a live band and the ride was smooth and drinks were reasonably priced. I would recomment it to anyone who is not interested in a ultra modern hotel. The throwback rooms and atmoshere are very fun and great for a change from the uptown hotels. This is classic San Diego beach.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2014-03-29	3	Some things were old and needed updating or fixing but everything was clean. The beds were uncomfortable and you could hear the wind whistling through the patio door. The bathroom was clean and usable. The hotel is near a lot of tourist attractions like Sea World, Pacific beach and the San Diego Zoo.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2014-03-29	4	The place was full of "spring breaker" kids ( high school / college??) and it was a bit much for our family vacation. However, when we told the front desk staff that we would need to be moved to a quieter location they upgraded us to a very nice room away from all of the party goers. We are very thankful they did this - it saved the vacation!! Wonderful location right on Mission Bay, easy walk to Mission Beach. Lots of water sport rentals: paddle boards, peddle boats, etc.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2014-03-19	3	The hotel was located on a beautiful private bay. They only have one pool and hot tub, which was full of young adult drinkers. The Beds were small (full) and very uncomfortable. The resort had activities for the children during the day on Saturday, and also a free arcade room. The resort is within walking distance from Mission Beach, and a public bay. The one restaurant located at the resort was over priced, and the food was below average. It wasn't terrible, but we won't be going back.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2014-03-02	5	To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when we booked this hotel because it was so much less expensive than others in the area. I figured, you get what you pay for. I was so pleasantly surprised that although the exterior of the hotel is a bit retro, the interiors were AMAZING. We had a mini-suite and it was updated with beautiful finishes and we had plenty of room. The beds were comfortable, I wanted to steal their pillows - so heavenly! My one and only complaint was that there was no room for our ice cream in the tiny freezer shelf in the mini-fridge. Next time, we'll have to eat all of our ice cream ahead of time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2013-11-20	4	We desided to stay in SD last minute, I'd like to think we got a great deal. Everything went smooth and great, the front desk was not quite ready for us to check in, so they gave us the passes for the boat ride and allowed us to check in after. Our room was nice, with the exception of trash still in the trash can under the sink and some trash under the pull out couch bed.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Bahia Resort Hotel		2013-11-13	1	I think we were set up in staff lodging quarters. We would receive communications under our door addressed to staff. There was out of place furniture in our room that appeared to be there as storage. The couch had several tears in it. The bathroom was dirty. The location of our room was right outside of the elevator and above the garbage dumpster. There was no such thing as a restful sleep. There was another guests dirty dishes from room service outside of our door from the time we arrived on our first day until the next day.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">998 W.

Holiday Inn Express SAN DIEGO DOWNTOWN		2014-05-28	3	the room was clean, but the color of the walls and the carpet made the room seemed old. restroom was small, so for a couple girls that were trying to get ready, it made things a bit difficult. The one thing that I did not appreciate was that they charged parking, i was not told there would be a change when they first handed me the permit, all the front desk said was "here is your parking permit for our parking garage" and how to get there. at the end of the trip i was told there was a $32 dollar charge on my card for parking. First off, that sucks that you have to pay for parking when you already paid for the room, second, what would have happened we never used the garage? (it was a bit inconvenient) would they still have charged me? other than that the staff was friendly and the room was comfortable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1430 SEVENTH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Holiday Inn Express SAN DIEGO DOWNTOWN		2014-05-13	5	The hotel was very accomodating. We ended up getting an extra room so they comped us parking for 1 car. The breakfast was delicious and the lemonade in the lobby was refreshing. I didn't realize until the second day, but there are also delicious cookies in the lobby as well. The location was great. We were able to walk to gas lamp district and get there faster than taking a taxi (about $10).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1430 SEVENTH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Holiday Inn Express SAN DIEGO DOWNTOWN		2013-12-09	2	The lobby area is nice, but my room looked a bit worn out. Carpet had water stains, décor was really dated. Shower could use renovation. I stay at Holiday Inns up and down the coast for business, this is OK, but I have stayed in much nicer H. I. that have been renovated. Not worth the cost compared to other hotels in the area, especially the $16 a night parking fee......	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1430 SEVENTH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2014-06-09	5	Me and my wife decided to stay in the Hotel Indigo for the second time now because of its easy location to the Gaslamp and Petco Park area. It is just off the path enough to get out of each main area but its also close enough that you are right there. Great views as well.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">509 9TH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2014-05-28	4	The hotel was nice. The "view" from my view room was less than desirable.

Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2014-05-11	4	Never been to this hotel before and was a bit skeptical because it was not big name chain. Boy was I wrong. At first glance I was not sure, not fancy from the outside. When I arrived I was greated by hotel vallet who assisted me inside. This is my only negative about this hotel. Vallet is the only way to park and it cost 40 dollars. I thought that was a bit steep. -newline-  -newline- Once I entered hotel I was amazed at the modern decor, the fancy bar and how close it was to gas lamp and stadium. From this hotel you can walk to all the attractions and can walk to trolly and venture out to old town . This hotel has free wi-Fi and a awesome bar in the ninth floor that overlooks the baseball stadium. -newline-  -newline- Room - our room was amazing for the price. Super modern, clean, comfortable beds, safe, krugs coffee maker, and shower for two cause you gotta conserve water! Dogs are more then welcome at this hotel. They even have a grass area for the little guys. For the price I was truely impressed! I would recommend this place to friends and family.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">509 9TH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2014-03-17	4	Indigo is a wonderfully swanky yet unassuming little boutique hotel at the edge of the Gaslamp District of San Diego. The front desk staff are impeccably professional, helpful, and actually quite nice! Wi-fi is included, there's a fitness center, business center, and restaurant/bar. It's even a LEED-certified building! The room and bathroom are contemporary in appearance, but it's very comfortable. The large glass-enclosed shower (without tub) is quite luxurious. They even provide a Keurig machine with various cups so you can make a morning pick-me-up before you leave the room! -newline-  -newline- Several great little restaurants are easily within walking distance, like the Broken Yolk, and The Mission. Up on the roof there's a gorgeous deck/bar area, with gas firepits and an incredible view into the Padres stadium! I would definitely stay here again, no questions asked. The convention center is about a 10 minute brisk walk. The hustle and bustle of 5th street is just 4 blocks away, and Market Street is just one block away.

The staff were all really friendly, the rooms were perfectly clean, very spacious and beautifully decorated.

Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2013-09-23	4	Overall a great experience. A few things that the customer should know us that if your dog is barking at night while you are out and about in town, the hotel will call you to let you know that you need to comback to quiet your dog. The breakfast prices are ridiculously overpriced and if you don't want to walk 3 block with you luggage be prepared to pay $50 for valet parking per day.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">509 9TH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2013-08-13	4	The room was nice. The location was great. However, accommodating our 70lb dog puts Hotel Indigo above all the other hotels in the Gaslamp District. Most of the other hotels cap weights at 25lbs or 50lbs. Hotel Indigo accommodates all dogs, they are truly dog friendly. The only negative, is not directed at Hotel Indigo, rather the lack of grass in the area. However, a short walk down to PetCo Park will provide you with ample grass for your dog to take care of business.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">509 9TH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2013-08-05	3	Recently spent two nights here. Nice clean room. Thursday night fine - very comfortable bed. Friday night two big parties in the hotel. I get it, but was awakened at 2:30 and kept up until 4am with very noisy neighbors. Tried to call the front desk three times - no one ever answered! What if there had been an emergency? Made comments to the manager in the morning - in a nice way even though I wasn't feeling it - and was basically given the shrug off response. That was not good customer service in my opinion. In fact all the staff with the exception of Charolette at the front desk and Mike in the restaurant lacked enthusiasm and helpfulness.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">509 9TH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Hotel Indigo SAN DIEGO-GASLAMP QUARTER		2013-07-23	3	Great location. Sized shaped and laid out like a three star vegas hotel, at least on the strip. Looks ok for traveling with pets, but I don't have a dog anymore. My dog wouldn't have like this place, considering her fav was DoubleTree in Santa Barbra. The rooftop bar was ok. I saw more people staying at the hotel than any member of the staff just the front desk. But the staff was ok, well the ones I saw. I wouldn't stay here again, but then maybe it was because of Comicon that this stay was overpriced, short staffed, and average. Oh the shower stall needs to be redone, the showerhead kept following off it's holder, last but not least the 'view' was of more buildings vs any park. Maybe I need to find more fun places than the GasLamp District.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">509 9TH AVENUE, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

You can walk out of the pool gate right onto the paved boardwalk - really doesn't get better. -newline- Rooms are a bit dark, with low ceilings and there are few ceiling lights. Was upgraded to the presidential suite - essentially a very large room with a couch, and a jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom - slightly underwhelming given the grandiose name, but still very nice. -newline- Many rooms have kitchens kitchenettes - which are nice. Good ocean view from the rooms that have them - they tend to be right above the pool.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">610 Diamond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92106</span>

La Jolla Beach Travelodge		2014-07-31	4	The rooms are very well maintained, very well cleaned and refreshing. The complimentary breakfast did not have any room to eat in, only a few chairs outside.

La Jolla Beach Travelodge		2014-07-31	4	Compared to the prices of the other hotels in the vicinity, I didn't expect much from this hotel.

Room normal but bath old and ceiling squeaked when person upstairs walks.First night bad guest upstairs with TV noise at 1:30. I spoke with man but still had to get night manager to resolve issue. Nice pool area and oversudsy spa. Nearby restaurants look suspiciously dirty.

La Jolla Beach Travelodge		2013-06-26	4	The best feature about this hotel is its location a few blocks from the Windansea surf break. The staff is very helpful and the hotel has a pool, spa and coin laundry. Its also located next to a great Mexican hotel. The hotel is older and the room is dated, with an old tube style TV, older wallpaper and an itchy felt blanket, but is acceptably clean.

La Jolla Beach Travelodge		2013-04-16	4	This Travelodge is an extremely good value for the money. Everything is extremely clean, the rooms I stayed in both this stay and during a previous stay in January were very comfortable, and the staff members were friendly and accommodating both times I stayed there. The pool and laundary facilities are a bonus in a hotel in this price range. My only minor complaint is that the parking is tight in the parking lot. One night there were no spots available in the parking lots to the motel itself, but I was able to find a (free) spot on the street right in front. Excellent value for the money.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6750 La Jolla Blvd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">La Jolla</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92037</span>

Expected more from the room we stayed in, but it had a fire pit on the very private balcony on the first floor, which was a nice touch. I'd say the room was more bungalow style and could probably use revamping like their tower rooms but all things considered, we had a nice stay. Very family friendly with water slides. Bike rental included in our stay was a nice treat.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1441 Quivira Rd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92109</span>

Hyatt Regency Mission Bay Spa and Marina		2014-06-09	4	We flew from Vegas to San Diego for ' rehab ' at this hotel as we got married in Vegas . We were on the 14th floor in the tower and to be honest the room was fantastic with stunning views of the ocean . The only set back was we asked for a smoking room and the hotel was strictly no smoking !! A 250 dollar was imposed if you got caught !! The downside to the resort is you have to go outside for entertainment , think the hotel is geared up for business conferences mostly . Taxi fares return to gas lamp quarters are approx 50-60 dollars inc of tip !! BUT just outside the hotel is a bus stop and for 2.50 you take a 10 min ride to old town where you go to the train start ion and buy a 'compass card for 2 dollars and load it up with 5 dollars . This gives you a 24 hr pass for busses and trolleys (trains. ) along any routes so now you can get about for 5 dollars per day a huge saving on taxis !! And believe it or not it's just as quick if you get your timing right . Gas lamp quarter is great and we had a great time in Diego ! What the hotel doesn't tell you is that there is a. 20 dollar resort fee per room per day , for this you get internet , the use of a small gym. , cycle hire 2 bottles of water per day and 2 coffees and 1 cup of tea to share in your room ! If you hire a car they charge 30 dollars a night to park !!! Check out yor bill at the end of your stay as I got charged 58 dollars car parking and I didn't even have a car !!! This was sorted out without a fuss . Overall hotel great but really lacks entertainment	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1441 Quivira Rd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92109</span>
Hyatt Regency Mission Bay Spa and Marina		2014-05-07	4	Everything was great at this hotel. The only thing that was a little bit of a surprise was the $29/night self parking rate, so add in also the $19/night resort fee and you need to budget about an extra $50/ night. However, these prices were cheaper than our friends fees who stayed at a nearby resort... So I am not complaining about the price just letting you know to be prepared for it. Can't wait to come back soon with our kids!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1441 Quivira Rd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92109</span>
Hyatt Regency Mission Bay Spa and Marina		2014-04-16	3	My daughter held her wedding ceremony and reception at this location. The staff was superb in every respect, as was the food and all aspects of their service. -newline- The physical plant on the other hand showed many signs of neglect and disrepair: ie. many sections of the concrete walkways have shifted height and present many trip hazards. The walkway from the Red Marlin restaurant has many rotting members on the railing running from the building to the shore. Overall the lansdcaping around plants and trees looked deficient.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1441 Quivira Rd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92109</span>

Horton Grand Hotel		2014-07-24	4	This is our second trip to this hotel...it's fantastic! The location is awesome! It's right in the center of the Gaslamp District and Padres stadium. The staff is super nice and so helpful. My husband and I like to walk, so Seaport Village and the U.S.S. Midway is a pleasant half hour walk along the harbor. We really enjoy the multitude of things to do and the resturant selection in the Gaslamp.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2014-07-06	3	This hotel is a great structure and on it's way up. The staff is super to deal with and the building beautiful. it falls short on amenities and details. Coming soon is room service and work out facility, but not there yet. The bath could use some meticulous cleaning in the corners and straightening or towel bars, etc. The sheets show wear with pilling on the pillow cases. I hope to check back in a year or two to see if this hotel lives up to its potential	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2014-07-06	4	We are repeat customers at the Horton because of its location, and we like its unique vintage character. We can walk to the places we want (Petco Park, USS Midway, MTS Trolley) and avoid renting a car and paying the $30 daily parking fee. Cab fare to Balboa Park is around $10. New breakfast buffet is tasty and a reasonable price for the convenience ($12.95). Staff is friendly and helpful. Fourth floor courtyard is the quietest area, as Horton's location also brings noise from the Gaslamp District. Staff willingly relocated us after a first noisy night on the second floor (we were courtyard but had noisy neighbors, and the walls must be thin.) Next two nights were heavenly on a very comfy bed with elegant linens. Rooms are small but furnishings are new and in character with the hotel's vintage style. We would make a return visit.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2014-06-30	3	This is an OK hotel with a great location. It's historic in that the original hotel was relocated brick by brick when they built the Horton Plaza mall a couple of blocks away and reassembled (old hotel smell and all) in its current location. It has an old west feel to it but I'd trade the plastic horse in the lobby and Victorian trimmings for more power points in the room and a more comfortable bed. The location is great..it's firmly in the gaslamp quarter...most of what you might want is a short drunken stumble from the hotel. Parking is $30 and valet only which is about the norm downtown. Breakfast at $12 is comparable with what you would get for free at a Holiday Inn Express or Springfield. If you don't need the luxury don't mind the old lady smell and can get this for a decent price you will be fine.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Horton Grand Hotel		2014-06-17	5	The Horton Grand Hotel wasa great place to stay for our girls weekeend in June. The hotel is right in the middle of Glaslamp District of San Diego. Everything is within blocks of the hotel including the marina, great bars, and resteraunts. In great proximity to the MTS there light rail system so you can easily get to other regions of San Diego. The room was great we had a balcony that overlooked the streets. Room was nicely furnished and the hotel has a great atrium area accessible to all guests. The hotel staff was great at giving suggestions as well as letting us check in early! Great deal and great place to stay!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2014-06-15	4	Did a Ghost Line Tours a year back and the Horton was on the stop. For that reason it had stuck in my head. It is located in the gaslamp district. so if you are planning on getting your drink on, it is ideal for just parking and stumbling around for a lost weekend or two. I was there on a family outing so we did some travel from there. Everything was about 15-20 minutes away so it was great. The room we got was a good size mini suite. there were five of us so we got a roll away. Slept well. Room was clean but never restocked, that was a drag. had a fridge and a microwave- definitely a plus. staff was great. front desk helped us get the right room. parking attendants very cool. felt bad because i couldn't tip as i was literally cashless the entire stay. they didn't blink an eye, but i felt they deserved a tip better than a 'thank you' whch was all i could offer.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Horton Grand Hotel		2014-05-22	4	Quarter mile from the convention center just off the busy streets in the gaslamp quarter. Lots of restaurants close by. Morning runs along the harbor were nice, so a gym at the hotel was not needed. Room was on the smaller side, just enough room for 2 queen beds and a desk, but it wasn't uncomfortably crammed. Fireplace in the room, while not needed, gave it some character.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2014-05-02	5	This hotel has a great price and perfect location! Located right next to San Diego's hottest nightclub, and all the popular restaurants/bars.

Horton Grand Hotel		2014-03-18	5	This hotel is in the perfect place if you wish to stay in the Gaslamp District. I could walk to the convention center in only five minutes (and a very safe walk).

Horton Grand Hotel		2014-02-17	1	I wanted to love this place but it was horribly overpriced. We arrived to check in and the lobby was filled with people waiting for rooms, they were an hour late for check in and couldn't have been more rude. They lectured guests on the check in time instead of apologizing because they were clearly wrong. Instrad they made us and numerous other guests wait for hours in the lobby with our bags piled in the corner. The room was sub par for the price, zero sound proofing and the room felt like we had spent $50 not $180. They double charged us for valet, and after me telling them we only had one car they accused me of lying instead of checking with the valet first. Overall horrible stay. I wouldn't stay here for free...	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2014-01-18	4	The main complaint I have of the hotel is that I would appreciate overnight parking without an additional fee. The hotel doesn't specify parking clearly and it seems like it should be covered complementary with your stay. Other than that the grounds were beautiful and the bar connected to the lobby was excellent!

Horton Grand Hotel		2013-08-12	4	Wonderful stay at this totally modern yet historic hotel. The beds could not have been better. The room was perfectly clean and stayed that way throughout our stay thanks to the maid service. The hotel itself is filled with thoughtful touches that go above and beyond. An example is that the elevator passes little mini "rooms," set pieces of historic rooms with antiques. Something to look at during the ride! -newline- The only sour note was the valet runners. They absolutely could not get it together!! One day they took over 40 minutes to bring our car. Others got immediate service. On checkout they brought the wrong car then insisted we should "wait our turn" for them to try again. No tip, no love! -newline- Overall, a great little hotel within walking distance of the whole Gaslight district. Suggest 222 for breakfast (one block to left) but be prepared to wait in line on a weekend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2013-08-02	4	All of the negative review issues that I read no longer existed during my stay. For example, the internet connection was great, and there was a big modern tv. -newline-  -newline- Stuff that was missing: I was told that the room would have a mini fridge and microwave. It had neither. I did not complain, and if I had I may have been moved to a room that had these things, but I did not complain because the room was quiet, and I didn't want to get moved to a noisy location. There was a plethora of restaurants in the area, and I didn't spend much time in the room anyway. -newline-  -newline- I was also supposed to get 2 bottles of water every day, but only got 2 the entire 5-day stay. I drank tap - it wasn't too bad.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Horton Grand Hotel		2013-07-26	4	The only issues we had was poor parking and not knowing that you could only park on one side one night and the other the next d/t street cleaning.

Horton Grand Hotel		2013-07-18	2	The location was great- within walking distance to everything in the Gaslamp District but located off of a quiet little side street which was nice. This historic hotel has a beautiful exterior, lobby, and commons area. Areas of the hotel smelled old but our room smelt good. The room was small but clean & the restroom was in need of general maintenance. The older lady at the front desk is rude, but everyone else we encountered was pleasant (stayed for 3 days). Valet parking is $25 daily- but its worth it considering that parking garages cost much more!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Horton Grand Hotel		2013-06-25	4	Cute old-timey hotel. Nice room size... Comfortable and quiet. Only complaint is parking. There was a big game so rooms were sold out and they were short on parking.i drove back to the hotel at 11pm and was told I had to find my own parking. Had to park 3 blocks away and pay $32 for the night!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">311 Island Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Horton Grand Hotel		2013-06-07	5	The Horton Grand Hotel is in a perfect location for wandering around San Diego, with lots of great restaurants close by. Our stay was indeed perfect.

Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-07-15	4	My BF and I decided to stay at this hotel on our trip to SD. We liked the room and the hotel. Overall, the location was great. We like how close it was to many of the sights we wanted to see. There are also many great restaurants within walking distance.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-07-14	4	One block to trolley and many restaurants and Petco Park -newline- Very nice rooms and good service. Restaurant and Bar -newline- a liitle pricey. Self park across street for $15 perday -newline- compared to valet at hotel for $38. Lighting in room makes -newline- reading difficult.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-07-13	4	The staff here are very nice and helpful. However, for the price, I was hoping that at least a few things (parking, breakfast) would be complimentary. They sure aren't! Parking cost $38/day, and the restaurant is very pricy as well. We enjoyed our stay overall (the pool and jacuzzi were fantastic), but I think we won't stay in such a loud location next time. Gaslamp district is LOUD!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-07-10	4	Everything was perfect specially the location. The only thing was that on their wifi agreement they say if you sign up for royalty plan the wifi would be free. The hotel then charged me $10 for wifi but they later reimbursed me because their website doesn't explain it clearly that you should've also booked your stay directly through the hotel to take advantage of the offer. It was a little bit of an inconvenience at check out time to resolve the issue but staff were great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-07-08	4	This is my second time staying at a Omni Hotel. They continue to impress. The restaurant inside the hotel had pretty good food. Only issue was parking, which was a whopping $38 per day. Other than that there is nothing really to complain about. It's a great hotel and I would definitely stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-06-17	5	We loved our stay at the Omni San Diego. The hotel is clean, modern and very impressive in every way. We have stayed at the Solamar and Hard Rock hotel near by and the Omni has exceeded our expectation. The room is very comfortable and clean. The location is within walking distance to many great restaurants. We mentioned we were in San Diego to celebrate our anniversary and they upgraded our room to bay view. And as an added bonus, they sent up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a personalized note to help celebrate the occasion. Thank you Omni for a great stay! We will be back.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-06-08	5	My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience at the Omni!!! -newline-  -newline- The staff, unfortunately, told us we could enter Petco Park 2 hours before the game via the skybridge, which was incorrect. -newline-  -newline- The dumb dumb "elite" security made everyone wait until 1.5 hours before game and would not let us in. The "elite" staff and the ticket-takers were just standing on the stadium side of the gate talking to each other. -newline-  -newline- It was extremely disappointing because it was the second Beerfest and we were 30 min late because of this. On the bright side, we ended up not spending an extra $20 on beer because of having to wait... Hmm, I wonder if the Padres ownership would approve of this practice??!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Omni San Diego Hotel		2014-05-06	4	Stayed three nights for a nearby conference. Very good, not spectacular, four star hotel. Be aware that the Padre games can be loud on the Petco Park side.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">675 L Street, 675 L Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-07-24	3	Overall basic essentials. Decent value for summer in San Diego. Pricey car valet service ($30).   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-07-21	4	Very small rooms, but very clean and well planned. Can't best the location. Valet parking $30 but most hostels in Gaslamp are $40 so good deal. We would definitely stay here again.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-07-20	3	Good bed, in-room wifi. Nothing much to look at from the city view room but glimpses into other rooms at the back seemed to show garden outlooks. The toilet bowl is tiny and about 14" off the floor in the shower room, which may be an issue for those with limited mobility. Shower stall only, no tub. Microwave, fridge and safe in room. A better bathroom would make it a great stay. Near First Ave, so a fair walk along Broadway to all the eateries and bars on 5th Ave. Helpful staff and bus to Seaworld runs right outside - No. 30 then No. 9. An easy stroll down to harbour exhibits or take a bus. Buy the $5 day pass for public transport right near the stop in the Transport Office nearby and have a $5 return trip to Seaworld.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-07-03	5	The Sofia was the perfect place for my short stay in San Diego. It was close to all the best restaurants and entertainment in San Diego so I didn't need to pay extra for a cab to get anywhere. It's also on the bus line that goes to Coronado Beach, which only 30 minutes via bus. The front desk clerk even provided me with a bus pass, which I used to go to the beach and got to see more of the city. Another great amenity they have there is are the free bike rentals. They don't have too many bikes, so if you're interested in seeing San Diego via bike, get there early in the morning. The restaurant also has very good breakfast. I later found out that it's one of the best restaurants in town. If I'd known earlier I would've gone for dinner. Overall, this was an awesome experience.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-06-23	4	The only draw back to this property is that the rooms are very small. But they are well furnished and very clean. It's a great location at the edge of the Gaslamp District and I would recommend it.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-06-13	4	The hotel is in a great location and the staff was wonderful. There were a few non-negotiable misc. charges of $8/night that was not posted on the website that we did not learn of until we were at the hotel which was frustrating. However, the hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and it is located in a wonderful spot between the gaslamp quarter and the bay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-06-05	4	Stayed there for a night to run the San Diego Rock and Roll Marathon. Checked in Saturday morning, the staff was friendly and quick. The room was clean and quiet. It is close from the convention center. Close to the glass lamp district . Close to Balboa park where the race starts.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-06-03	4	Space is utilized in a very economic way- but feels you're crunched. I stayed during a conference, so did not spend much time n the room...overall is okay   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

The Sofia Hotel		2014-04-21	3	The location is in the heart of downtown San Diego so that was awesome. -newline-  -newline- Pros: lots of places were walking distance, amenities like 2 water bottles per day, free bike rentals, and free internet were included for a reasonable fee. -newline-  -newline- Cons: Since the only rooms available had only 1 bed, I requested a King bed so that my friend and I could sleep comfortably. They ran out of king beds so we were upgraded to a "suite" with a queen bed. The so-called suite was tiny. I can't imagine how uncomfortably small a regular room would have been. The floors were uneven in certain parts of the room which was strange. -newline-  -newline- If you're not planning to spend a lot of the time in the room, this hotel will be fine.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-04-21	3	The hotel gave the expired coffee and Condiments dated before "19 Feb. 2013", which could harm the guest who did drink the coffee and use the condiments.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-04-06	4	I really enjoyed my stay at the Sofia. The staff was super nice from the minute I arrived thru to checkout. I had a drink in the restaurant/lounge, Currants, and that was positive too. Plus there is a Tender Greens restaurant and a Coffee Bean on the same block which was handy. Lots of other great restaurants are an easy walk. The room was very well appointed. Being a historic hotel it is a bit on the small size as others have mentioned, but it was not a problem for me. My only complaint, and it is pretty minor, was that the room a/c made the room too cool when it cycled on and then too hot otherwise. I know, first world problem. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-04-01	4	Cute boutique hotel. Although the rooms are not big it was perfect for my partner and I. If you check in with yelp you get a free yoga DVD.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-03-30	4	This hotel is unique compared to the average chain hotel. It is very charming inside. The room was on the smaller side given the cost for the night, but it was very nice! The largest bed the hotel offers is a queen, but it was very comfortable. -newline-  -newline- The hotel also has a room for yoga 24hr. They rent out bikes from 7am-7pm on a first come first serve basis, which is an awesome perk. That would be a fun way to get around the city!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
The Sofia Hotel		2014-03-24	4	Very convenient location to conferences, local attractions, shopping, groceries, buses, and trains. -newline-  -newline- Super having yoga room and bicycles available. -newline-  -newline- Would stay again!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 West Broadway, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

The Sofia Hotel		2014-02-17	4	Pretty hotel located within walking distance to the convention center and bay front.

Doubletree Hotel San Diego-Mission Valley		2014-07-10	4	Room was clean & comfortable. Room service (& complimentary check in cookie) were delicious. Parking was slightly high considering we were staying at the hotel ($19 a day). Staff was pleasant but seemed "busy." They didn't t go out of they're way to see if there was any way to check in an hour earlier on day 1 and upon check out, the front desk person wasn't rude but not exactly what I would call friendly . Other than personality... The hotel & location were great for the price...	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7450 Hazard Center Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92108</span>
Doubletree Hotel San Diego-Mission Valley		2014-07-08	4	Room was clean, hotel amenities were great and staff were nice. Only issue I had was having to pay extra to rent a fridge and microwave.

Other than those issues, we had a great stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7450 Hazard Center Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92108</span>
Doubletree Hotel San Diego-Mission Valley		2014-05-27	4	Nice hotel, clean, staff was very responsive. We were close to USD (attending a graduation) and Old Town San Diego.

Doubletree Hotel San Diego-Mission Valley		2014-05-26	4	The room was clean. The staff was polite and helpful. The only issue was the parking.

Hilton San Diego Bayfront		2014-06-28	4	Can not ask for a better location or a more magnificent view. Stayed here for the biotech convention and had excellent access to convention center and the GasLamp district. Only issue was no complimentary coffee in lobby area due to the Starbucks in the hotel. Otherwise, the access to the waterfront and the rest of the city, tied with the great Hilton brand make this a winner.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1 Park Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Hilton San Diego Bayfront		2014-06-16	4	This was a great hotel. Rooms were clean and friendly staff. The pool was crowded with kids during the daytime, but it was nice at night. I also liked that this hotel is pet friendly. It only cost one $50 pet cleaning fee for the entire stay. However, the self parking for $30 a night is ridiculous. That should be included for the hotel guests.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1 Park Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>
Hilton San Diego Bayfront		2014-06-16	3	Went for a weekend getaway. I think it was a bit chaotic. The pool was open to people not even staying at the hotel so it was way overcrowded. -newline- It was within walking distance to the gas lamp quarters and all the dinning so that was good. There were plenty of food options. -newline- We did order room service, for what was received, way over priced. Side of fruit for $7.00 consisted of about 7 pieces of bite sized fruit. -newline- The bed was super uncomfortable. My husband and I both woke up with back pain from tossing and turning around. I think for what you pay, it should be excellent..... but it definitely lacks the '4' star quality it claims to be.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1 Park Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Diego</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92101</span>

Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines		2014-06-23	4	This hotel is really for the golfer. Rooms were clean and quiet. Location not so great...unless it is golf you are there for. Ocean barely visible from the hotel. No real access to beaches or ocean front. Torrey pines reserve was not too impressive....although you can eventually get to the ocean after a couple miles of walking through the desert. Parking too expensive!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10950 North Torrey Pines Road, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">La Jolla</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92037</span>

Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines		2014-01-19	4	Hotel very clean updated and remodeled. Perfect if you love golf as you get onto Torrey Pines, one of the great public courses in the US. Of course for a price... -newline- If not golfing, hotel very nice but removed from rest of SD and even short drive from la Jolla. Little isolated which is good or bad depending on what you're looking for. -newline- One thing is that staff was great!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10950 North Torrey Pines Road, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">La Jolla</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92037</span>

Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines		2013-06-17	1	Whwen ch ekcing onto our room. We were given a conference room to sleep in with single rollaway bed in it as opposed to regular room with the king size bed we reserved. There was no TV, phone etc. The water service ans mints had been left out from the prvious meeting. The hotels answer was the had overbooked and this was all they could do. It was a pitiful situation with awful customer service. I certainly expected more from a Hilton. Will never stay here again!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10950 North Torrey Pines Road, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">La Jolla</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92037</span>
Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines		2013-06-05	4	As a family we like to take vacations to fun and relaxing locations. We don't travel very often but when we do we like to get our moneys worth. I honestly believe that for the price of the room for 2 nights and two queens for two adults and our two children we did get more than our money's worth. Our stay was quiet and had no issues with the stuff nor with anyone else staying at the hotel. We were just a few minutes away from seaworld, the zoo, and the zoo safari. Our personal favorite was the safari. The only thing that would have made it better was maybe not having to pay for parking for every night stayed but overall our stay was wonderful and weather was just beautiful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10950 North Torrey Pines Road, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">La Jolla</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92037</span>
Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines		2013-06-04	4	Overall this is a generally great value ... the hilton sits RIGHT next to the lodge at Torrey Pines which is on an award winning golf course overlooking the cliffs and the ocean ... but for about half the price. Sweet! -newline-  -newline- Nothing special in terms of F&B or amenities but ALL that you need, including a Starbucks and pool. Staff even helped us out - we needed safety pins for our tags for the 1/2 marathon we were running. Katie at the front desk decomposed a couple of sewing kits to get us what we needed ... yay Katie thank you!! -newline-  -newline- Where they can improve: parking is awkward and pricey, timing of housekeeping not ideal and no 'make up my room' cards. Minor ... I'd stay again any day ...	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10950 North Torrey Pines Road, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">La Jolla</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">92037</span>
