ReviewText:Nice staff, hotel is a short walk to union square, so convenient travelling to the airport with Bart. I would recommend this hotel if you need to be at Union square for the value for money.

ReviewText:The room was small but not too small, it was very clean and as a tall guy I enjoyed the larger shower. We had a beautiful view and the location was perfect. It felt peaceful

ReviewText:High level of courtesy by the staff, very convenient location. Small room but perfectly adequate. Amenities at the hotel, like the spa have extra charges. Must pay extra for WiFi/Internet service in the room.

ReviewText:I did not get the room I paid for. They gave me room with a queen bed and I paid for a king. I needed a larger bed I am 6.6 tall and do not fit on a queen bed.

ReviewText:We have stayed at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco many times and each time it feels new. Located in the bustle of downtown near Powell Street this hotel envelopes you in its soft quiet elegance the minute you enter the lobby. The room was impeccable, with great linens and the rooms are situated as to muffle any hallway or room-to-room noise. Customer Service is the driving force to a wonderful stay. An added bonus is the Starbucks right next door!

ReviewText:As I am an avid traveler for both pleasure and business, I frequent hotels around the US weekly. Hotel Nikko was my first time stay this past weekend and the level of courteous staff to the beautiful and clean rooms and prompt room service, they easily surpassed my expectation. Definitely try the corner junior suite. It was fantastic and well below average value for such an opulent accommodation. Highly recommend Hotel Nikko in SF. I will never stay anywhere else while I is it SF.

ReviewText:This well-situated hotel was close to much of what one wants to do as a tourist in San Francisco. The check-in/out process was swift, effortless and virtually without any questions. The hotel staff was uniformly polite, nice and efficient. A fine area for finding a taxi or having people meet you is provided. Excellent breakfast buffet with both extensive western and Asian choices. Marvelous views from the 25th floor. Excellent workout facility and spa. Overall, an excellent choice.
