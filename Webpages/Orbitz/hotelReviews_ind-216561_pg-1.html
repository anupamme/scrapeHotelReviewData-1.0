ReviewText:The rooms are very basic. Has all the essentials and is clean. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable. We were there during a heat wave and didnt know there was no air conditioning. The location is a bit too far north of the center of downtown if you are planning on walking everywhere. All in all a good experience.

ReviewText:The location is great. Right by a major bus stop and only a mile or so walk to Pike Place Market, not to mention across the street from a nice Safeway and near many restaurants and Seattle Center (Space Needle, Chiluly Museum, EMC, etc.). Yes the room is a bit outdated but it's still fine and very clean. Fortunately had an outer room, 5th floor, and kept the window open and ceiling fan on high. Patrick at the front desk hooked us up. Ear plugs required for light sleepers though.

ReviewText:I had stayed here before in the winter. I wanted to come back in the summer and enjoy the rooftop deck. The weather was perfect to do so. Beautiful view of Puget Sound, Mt. Rainier, the and Seattle. Fun bonus is meeting lots of people enjoying the view from the deck also. It was nice having a Coffee shop on location and to be able to enjoy my morning mocha on the rooftop. They do not have food at the hotel but a lot of choices within walking distance. I used the hotels book of choices in my room. it gave a list showing all the places close, their dining, carry out or delivery options. I had fast delivery to my room on a busy 4th of July night within a half hour.. I just wished when I booked early I would get a room with a view. I get a great price just haven't got the view. Maybe next time.

ReviewText:It's not great but it's clean and pretty decent. -newline-  -newline- It's the hotel equivalent of IKEA furniture.

ReviewText:I only stayed a single night but the staff were both friendly and helpful. The area has numerous good restaurants and bars. The Mediterranean Inn is also very conveniently located near the training center I attend. I will definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:Great location, a bit noisy if you're a light sleeper. Small insignificant things needed some maintenance but overall the room was very clean and you couldn't ask for a better location for the price. Just remember that you're not at 5 star hotel, but you're not paying for one either.
