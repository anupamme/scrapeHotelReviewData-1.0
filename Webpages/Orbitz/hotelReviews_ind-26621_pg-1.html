ReviewText:We thought the hotel was ok and they had free wine in the evenings. If I went back I would stay closer to the piers where things are newer.

ReviewText:Brought my girlfreind here to celebrate her birthday for the weekend. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous, concierge made extra effort providing champagne, chocolate and a greeting card on our arrival. Hotel is right in the middle of it all and convenient walking distance to most of downtown. Would definitely reccommend or stay again here.

ReviewText:People anywhere make or break the experience and the staff at Kimpton Monaco Hotel is absolutely the best! They really care about their guests. Excellent stay at a wonderful hotel. Our room was super clean, comfortable and quiet. Bed and comforter were very comfortable. Coffee in the mornings and wine from 5-6 was a plus.

ReviewText:Disappointed by the concierge. We wanted to go to Gary Danko for our anniversary dinner. We we discouraged to go because we were told there was a ten month waiting list. So we decided to go somewhere else. When we got back to the hotel after our dinner, another couple was talking to the concierge about how great her recommendation was to go to Gary Danko for dinner that night. Just blew my mind why she would recommend a restaurant to someone else and not to us..... I would not recommend this place. The best service we received were from the door men they were prompt and respectful. -newline-  -newline- As far as location, you cannot walk and explore the surrounding area especially at night to the west or south of the hotel. Very dangerous. -newline-  -newline- Local phone call is not free in the hotel. They will charge you.

ReviewText:The room decor was somewhat jangling rather than soothing, although the bed and furniture were comfortable. There were some annoying room noises such as a small minibar fridge that rattled off and on thru the night. The bathroom was very nice however, though it sometimes took 30 seconds or longer to get hot water flowing from the showerhead. However, these are quibbles: staff were solicitous, breakfast excellent and elevators fast. Great locale too.

ReviewText:The hotel and front desk were very helpful and friendly. Only issue was we had asked our air to remain on several times and every time we returned to our room the air was shut off. I even taped a note on the air control unit.

ReviewText:In general the hotel is clean, well-maintained, pleasantly decorated. I found rooms to be a bit too small. Overall I would recommend this place to fellow travelers.
