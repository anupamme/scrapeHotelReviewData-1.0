ReviewText:The room was nice. The location was great. However, accommodating our 70lb dog puts Hotel Indigo above all the other hotels in the Gaslamp District. Most of the other hotels cap weights at 25lbs or 50lbs. Hotel Indigo accommodates all dogs, they are truly dog friendly. The only negative, is not directed at Hotel Indigo, rather the lack of grass in the area. However, a short walk down to PetCo Park will provide you with ample grass for your dog to take care of business.

ReviewText:Recently spent two nights here. Nice clean room. Thursday night fine - very comfortable bed. Friday night two big parties in the hotel. I get it, but was awakened at 2:30 and kept up until 4am with very noisy neighbors. Tried to call the front desk three times - no one ever answered! What if there had been an emergency? Made comments to the manager in the morning - in a nice way even though I wasn't feeling it - and was basically given the shrug off response. That was not good customer service in my opinion. In fact all the staff with the exception of Charolette at the front desk and Mike in the restaurant lacked enthusiasm and helpfulness.

ReviewText:Great location. Sized shaped and laid out like a three star vegas hotel, at least on the strip. Looks ok for traveling with pets, but I don't have a dog anymore. My dog wouldn't have like this place, considering her fav was DoubleTree in Santa Barbra. The rooftop bar was ok. I saw more people staying at the hotel than any member of the staff just the front desk. But the staff was ok, well the ones I saw. I wouldn't stay here again, but then maybe it was because of Comicon that this stay was overpriced, short staffed, and average. Oh the shower stall needs to be redone, the showerhead kept following off it's holder, last but not least the 'view' was of more buildings vs any park. Maybe I need to find more fun places than the GasLamp District.

ReviewText:Hotel Indigo in San Diego rocks! The most outstanding experience was the staff. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful. The locaton is a bit remote, however when we got our bearings, we discovered that we were three blocks from the "happenings". We loved the ninth floor lounge and the cool fire pit. We were able to watch the baseball game from the ninth floor lounge. Great place for dogs. Food was very good. I would highly recomend this hotel to my friends and family. Great time!
