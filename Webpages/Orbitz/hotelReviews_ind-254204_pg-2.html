ReviewText:The staff was great, room was a bit small but clean and very comfortable. Location was a bit removed, but not a far walk from Union Square, Embarcadero, etc. Would definitely stay here again

ReviewText:Let me start with saying that I until 48 hours ago, I have never stayed in a four-star hotel. I've mostly stayed at local motels or hostels. I wanted to get out town for the day and see the sights with my boyfriend; we've had a rough year and I figured it would be a nice treat for us to stay somewhere nice. -newline-  -newline- When we first checked in, everything was fine. The gentleman assisting us was friendly and professional; it was only when he attempted to bill my card $200 for an "incidentals" deposit that we began to have problems. He didn't even tell me what he was doing beforehand- every step of the way, he explained what he was doing until the end [which, in hindsight, is also weird]. I explained to him that we are low-income, and that we had only brought $100 in spending money for the trip. I mentioned that I did not recollect any mention of a deposit on the hotel's page or on my confirmation. -newline-  -newline- He became very rude and sneered at me with, "In EVERY hotel in EVERY part of the world, you will have to pay a deposit." A bit taken aback, I asked him to clarify what "incidentals" were, and if we could simply remove them from our room so we would not have to pay for them. He said they could- but I'd still have to pay the deposit for them. Which made absolutely NO sense to me. He said he could make an exception for me and "only" charge me $100. Again, I paid $100 for items that have been disabled in my room- room service, restaurant tab, laundry services, movies, etc. -newline-  -newline- At this point, I was feeling the desperation sink in and tried to explain the situation again. He basically told me if I didn't pay what I had, I couldn't get our room- and I would not be refunded the booking fee. The look he gave me made me feel so humiliated; like I'm not a valued "elegant guest" because I don't have a ton of money. At this point, I was crying; I gave him the money and we went upstairs. -newline-  -newline- In additon to some of the other patrons being INCREDIBLY rude [several women pushed my boyfriend aside to get in the elevator multiple times], the basic amnities that you would find elsewhere re unavailable here- or impossible to find, like the ice machine. Some of the lights did not work in the bathroom, there were open holes in the wall from where fixtures had been moved, and there was only one outlet for us to charge our phones- it was in the doorway of our room. -newline-  -newline- The one good thing about our room was the bed. I've never slept in a bed that soft; it was probably one of the best night's sleep I've had in a long, long time. -newline-  -newline- When we checked out, our clerk this time was much nicer, and everyone was super sweet- a total 180 from the previous day. We were promptly refunded our deposit, and gladly spent our money elsewhere. -newline-  -newline- I will come back to check out their holiday displays during Christmastime, but I will NEVER, EVER stay here again. Any "luxury" hotel that is so unaccomodating and rude to paying guests needs an overhaul.

ReviewText:The Palace is reminiscent of the grand hotels of the last century where elegance, exquisite architecture and polite, attentive staff was the norm. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel, where customer service is still of the highest importance, may I suggest a stay at The Palace Hotel.

ReviewText:Great location and central to a lot in the city. People are very friendly too. I came back from jogging one morning and was offered water by two people. Rooms are spacious and nicely appointed. Only issue is noise. I could hear my neighbors in the rooms next door as if they were actually in my room. They weren't being obnoxious either, just thin walls it appears.

ReviewText:From the very minute I walked towards the entry the hotel staff was more than happy to assit. It was my mother's first time staying at the Palace and she absolutely loved it. The Palace is located to good shopping and great restaurants.

ReviewText:I have always loved the Pied Piper for an after show drink and decided to stay overnight with my sweetheart for a special treat. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly from the first impression at valet parking to the front desk, bell people, restaurant/bar and cleaning crew. We were very impressed by all of the staff we interacted with. Our room was beautiful and clean, and the bed was so comfortable! Breakfast at Garden Court was delicious and beautiful, and drinks at Pied Piper was exactly how I like it, subdued with a good pour. For my girlfriend's first stay in a luxury hotel, I certainly picked the right place!

ReviewText:The Palace hotel is historical as well as elegant, I have always wanted to stay at this hotel and They had a great price. The staff and ammenties are a plus. The only complaint if I had to make one is that they do not offer free wifi in the room but that being said the lobby is such a great place to people watch!
