ReviewText:I was looking for a change of scenery after staying in Union Square for business all week, and while normally I stay away from the more touristy areas near Fisherman's Wharf, the Argonaut was perfect. Close to the best possible route for a run along Marina Green with a view of the Golden Gate bridge, lounging at the park at Fort Mason, sipping Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista, or catching a great meal across the street. The hotel has a lot of personality; rooms are nicely decorated, comfortable and clean, main lobby is a nice place to relax, and staff was very friendly and professional.

ReviewText:The Argonaut is a unique hotel, in the perfect location on fisherman's wharf, close to so many wonderful sights. Staff were always helpful, professional and courteous. King room was very comfortable and spacious enough but not huge. Complementary Happy Hour wine and beer were a nice touch. While our stay was so very short, we were so very glad we selected the Argonaut. Wish we could have had more time to enjoy some of the other amenities.

ReviewText:The hotel was clean and the staff was great. The location cannot be beat - right next to Ghiradehli square and right on fisherman's warf. Everything was within walking distance. The only downside was a first floor room and a significant amount of exterior noise. (ie.. garbage pickup at 5:30 a.m.). Otherwise the hotel was nice - No real restaurant in the hotel but many, many nearby.

ReviewText:Good location, but unfortunately it is currently in the middle of a construction zone making parking and access very difficult. Valet service took from 30 minutes to over an hour to retreive car each time. Price for this "prompt" service is $46 per day. The staff was friendly, but there was just not enough of them to keep things moving. The hotel is unique and the rooms are clean, but just not what I have come to expect from a Kimpton property.
