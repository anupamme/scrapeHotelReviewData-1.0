ReviewText:My daughter & I stayed here for the second time on our annual birthday weekend in the city. We love the location - easy to walk to restaurants, Fanuel Hall, and the T. Our room was an over-sized accessible corner room. Beds are very comfortable. Concierge was knowledgeable and friendly. We had dinner the 1st night at the hotel (under renovations)- good meal for fixed price, with excellent service. Continental breakfast was comped for birthday - more than adequate - fresh fruit, pastries, and cold cereal. We'll be back.

ReviewText:The heat didn't work in our room on a cold fall night. Blankets worked great and, otherwise, the hotel was amazing. The concierge staff was extremely helpful. Management compensated us with late checkout for the heat not working which was a great help. -newline-  -newline- Second trip to this hotel....would stay a third time for sure.
