ReviewText:Pros: -newline-  -newline- * Great walking distance to the Ballpark (about 10-12 minutes). -newline- * Staff on-site is very courteous and friendly -newline- * Connected to a shopping mall -newline- * Very comfortable beds -newline- * Great view from our rooms -newline- * HUGE lobby -newline-  -newline- Cons: -newline-  -newline- * Small bathrooms -newline- * Awful water pressure in the showers (we experienced the same shower pressure between 4 rooms on 2 different floors) -newline- * Staff over the phone were very rude in discussing anything about our reservations. (We were basically told we shouldn't have booked our reservations through a 3rd party). -newline- * Try to get a room that is NOT located near the elevator, if you do, you will hear it all night. -newline- * $49 parking EACH night you are there. -newline- * Wifi is $9.99 in your room or free in the lobby (Understand that before you connect). -newline- * Continental breakfast is not included in your room price and is an additional $16-25 per person. (There is a Starbucks directly across from the Continental breakfast, go there and get a cheaper meal, we did)

ReviewText:I travel to Boston twice a year from South Africa to visit my son, who has been living in Boston for the past 15 years. I have stayed at many hotels and find the Sheraton to be the ideal hotel for me. It is perfectly situated, has an excellent gym/pool, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff are courteous.

ReviewText:I stayed at the Sheraton in December 2013. Ideal location with access to the indoor mall and all other important sites. It was raining during my stay and I was able to do all my shopping without wearing a coat or umbrella. On my last day, my flight back home was in the late afternoon. The reservation desk extended my checkout so that I could keep my belongings in my room. Will definitely stay at the Sheraton the next time I visit Boston!

ReviewText:We needed a hotel at the Prudential Center, and we needed it to be affordable. Sheraton did the trick - good rate (not sure if it was a normal rate or a sale), comfortable room, perfect location. Breakfast buffet for $25 was a great fill-you-up meal without all the fancy frills that make many hotel brunches in the city much more expensive.
