ReviewText:I took my grandchildren here for a couple of days and they had a great time. They learned to paddle board and watched a movie while swimming in the hotel pool. They also taught themselves to play tennis in a lovely scenic garden.

ReviewText:It's an older building, but the rooms have had some renovation and service was terrific. I reserved a queen room with complimentary internet. When I called to ask for early check-in at 9am, they said my room was ready "now" and reserved it for me! It turned out to be a king room with a view of Mission Bay and a full kitchen!

ReviewText:Myself, my wife and 4 year old were in San Diego for a Military Graduation. We really enjoyed this hotel. Two blocks from Mission Beach, a private beach in the bay with cabana chairs which was a great way to wind down and let our daughter play. We had a car but did not need we rented beach cruiser bikes and cruised the boulevards. Hotel was close to everything, clean, and friendly, helpful staff. Have already recommended hotel to family

ReviewText:This place is great! The rooms are nice and the landscape is amazing. There are small streams, ducks, and flowers everywhere. As a guest you get to ride the triple deck cruiser for free as well as use the cabanas along the bay. The kids loved the rescued seals, the heated pool, and the beach. There is also an amusement park across the street and tons of other things to around the resort. It was a great stay!

ReviewText:I was at the bahia for both business and pleasure. I had a room on the fourth floor in the building by the bay and the view was excellent. My room was clean, pleasant, and comfortable. The staff were very courtious, and besides a little slow service in the cafe at times, there is not much to complain about. My family and i went out on the bahia Belle one night and had a great time. There was a live band and the ride was smooth and drinks were reasonably priced. I would recomment it to anyone who is not interested in a ultra modern hotel. The throwback rooms and atmoshere are very fun and great for a change from the uptown hotels. This is classic San Diego beach.

ReviewText:Some things were old and needed updating or fixing but everything was clean. The beds were uncomfortable and you could hear the wind whistling through the patio door. The bathroom was clean and usable. The hotel is near a lot of tourist attractions like Sea World, Pacific beach and the San Diego Zoo.

ReviewText:The place was full of "spring breaker" kids ( high school / college??) and it was a bit much for our family vacation. However, when we told the front desk staff that we would need to be moved to a quieter location they upgraded us to a very nice room away from all of the party goers. We are very thankful they did this - it saved the vacation!! Wonderful location right on Mission Bay, easy walk to Mission Beach. Lots of water sport rentals: paddle boards, peddle boats, etc.
