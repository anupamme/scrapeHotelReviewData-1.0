ReviewText:I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The rooms were small (as expected) but the staff was so friendly and helpful. Originally got a room with 1 double bed and had no problem getting a room with an extra bed. The bathroom was very clean and up to date. Overall my friends and I had a good experience and the location was great. I would stay here again.

ReviewText:Although the Nob Hill Hotel was a bit old-fashioned, our room was bright and charming. The location is ideal. It allows easy access to China Town, the tour-bus stops, and the treasures of Nob Hill itself.

ReviewText:If you're just looking for an inexpensive-ish place to stay near Union Square, you've found it. Don't expect a room much larger than your bed and a table, and don't look for food or drinks within the hotel!

ReviewText:This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in on a business trip, and that's saying a lot. Just one example: no AC, just an old filthy window fan and a window with no screen to use it in. The list goes on and on...

ReviewText:The rooms didn't look nothing like the pictures that were posted. There was no AC you were actually given a fan . The employee in the front desk was really nice and helped us out but the hotel isn't all that as it said it was.

ReviewText:I booked a room at this hotel for three days after viewing the photographs of the rooms etc on line. It looked somewhat European and different, which I liked. -newline- On arriving at the hotel late at night my wife and I were given a room that was no bigger then a cupboard. Certainly not at all good accommodation for two people. The metal bed head and bottom board were broken the wash hand basin was in the bedroom and not in the bathroom, The room paintwork was chipped the bedside chair was broken and disgusting as no one would want to sit on it. We checked the bed linen as I was expecting the worse. As it was late we slept in the room, all night the hot water pipes rattled and kept us awake. In the morning I asked for a room change and got it. Thankfully the room was a whole lot better. -newline- I had to pay $30 a day to have the car parked on the last day, Saturday we had to wait over an hour to get the car returned to us. If this is a problem for the hotel as it obviously is, then don't offer the valet service? -newline- I would say to anyone booking this hotel before you pay for the hotel room if at all possible view the room first? If anyone had been given the room I had on check-in you would be definitely insulted. I would suggest to the hotel management to get a painter and decorator in as ]the rooms need a huge clean-up. As for the horrible small cupboard rooms...these are for brooms and mops only and should not be used for paying guests.

ReviewText:This hotel was fine, clean easy to get to Butâ€¦ it borders some not so nice neighborhoods in SF that you should be aware of - the tenderloin district. I can't believe with all the money in SF - they can't clean up both tenderloin and mission districts. Its appalling - quite honestly I don't see the appeal to SF - expensive, dirty and not very friendly.- Certainly this particular part was not the fault of the hotel.
