ReviewText:Not only was the location perfect, the staff was friendly down to every last employee. They were interested in you and how your stay was going. The updated hotel changed from Red Lion to Motif seemed like a mod hip hotel change. Very nice rooms. Well Done!

ReviewText:The staff is very accommodating and professional, but there are a couple of undesirable aspects about the room itself. The faucet only poured very hot water out. I had to brush my teeth using the shower. The shower was fine. Bed - no comforter. It's an old remodeled hotel but you can still see the old aspects of it.

ReviewText:This is a recently refurbished hotel which is bang on 5th Ave and is within a stones throw from the main shopping, market, business and leisure district. -newline- Would definite stay there again. -newline- Only downside was additional charges for parking and breakfast. -newline- The breakfast is not really a problem with the width and breadth of choice surrounding this hotel.

ReviewText:This is a wonderful place to stay for a few days or longer. -newline- A few hiccups along the way (room was a constant 70 *F despite a wall thermostat, housekeeping skipped a day), didn't deter us from fully enjoying the hotel. -newline- A dynamite multi-use patio serves as a breakfast/lunch/happy hour meeting place. Trendy and happening. -newline- Speaking of, be sure to check out the happy hour, here and all over town. It's not what you associate with a typical happy hour. Uniquely Seattle!

ReviewText:Well done remodel. Used to be Red Lion, now a trying-to-be-hip hotel with Mad Men decor and ill-fitting suits. Nice staff and room. Good furnishings but missing the mark in a few places. A room for 4 adults has only coffee for 2. Toiletries included 2 conditioners and no shampoo. The fridge provided was something from a freshman dorm room; small, old, and balanced on 3 wobbly legs. Elevator was a bit noisy, even though we were around the corner and across the hall from it. Garage has a 6'2" ht limit, but I think it's just under that. Another garage is available 2 blks away with 7' clearance. -newline- All in all, a great value in such a great location downtown. I'd stay here again without hesitation.

ReviewText:Best location in Seattle downtown so far. Been to hotel max and executive pacific hotel before. This is the best of them all in terms of location, noise, and decor. Staff are relatively equally all good at all 3 places. But omg the location was so convenient. So close to shopping and pike place. All very easy walks. Noise at executive pacific hotel was almost unbearable but this place was very quite aside from minor water pipe noise from other ppl taking showers. And they have a very well equipped fitness room. With tv for most equipment. And flavoured water like hotel max. Price was very good when on sale.

ReviewText:It was hard to find without using the address (which was not visible) as the name is now the Motif (no longer the Red Lion for some time). The parking was high ($39/day) and the accommodations were average even though the cost was above average. The food in the hotel was average as was the hotel restaurant service. The location for seeing downtown Seattle was great.
