ReviewText:We loved it and had a great experience! It was our first time at this hotel, but have been to others in Union Square and find it to be very special and I highly recommend it.

ReviewText:The hotel was fabulous location and we had a great stay. The check-in/out kiosks though were funky at best. Why not have a traditional check-in desk. Very confusing...

ReviewText:Made the accomodations last minute and found the price and hotel location exceptional for the 4 star status. Below are summary points of my experience: -newline- * Bed and pillows extremely comfortable -newline- * Work out are was tight but great views -newline- * Valet was expensive and a little odd that there was no place to drive in to avoid street trafic and you competed with cabs - for less money you could park accross the street but less convenient -newline- * front desk was confusing due to stations that you walk up to instead of traditional front desk location -newline- * Location to Union square was excellent

ReviewText:If you're looking for a great view, great shopping and great restaurants, then this place is the perfect location for all of it! -newline-  -newline- My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for our anniversary. It's right next to Union Square and a short walk to the Westfield Mall (with plenty of shops along the way to the mall). -newline-  -newline- There's more restaurants within a 5 minute walk than you could eat at in a month - and they are all fantastic. -newline-  -newline- The staff was very helpful - the concierges always pointed us in the right direction for shops, food, etc. -newline-  -newline- The only issue I had were the pillows (I prefer cotton vs. down pillows), but I didn't have the time to ask for cotton pillows (which they probably would have given me).

ReviewText:Needed an easily accessed meeting point for family members travelling from different points. Handy to car rentals, shopping , stations, variety of eating places,.. . Staff efficient but unintrusive. If price right again, would definitely return.
