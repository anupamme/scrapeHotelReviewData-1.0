ReviewText:Great deal on the price but got a handicap room. Tried to change rooms but hotel was fully booked. Customer service was great just not happy about room choice. Would probably not go back.

ReviewText:This hotel is really for the golfer. Rooms were clean and quiet. Location not so great...unless it is golf you are there for. Ocean barely visible from the hotel. No real access to beaches or ocean front. Torrey pines reserve was not too impressive....although you can eventually get to the ocean after a couple miles of walking through the desert. Parking too expensive!!

ReviewText:Hotel very clean updated and remodeled. Perfect if you love golf as you get onto Torrey Pines, one of the great public courses in the US. Of course for a price... -newline- If not golfing, hotel very nice but removed from rest of SD and even short drive from la Jolla. Little isolated which is good or bad depending on what you're looking for. -newline- One thing is that staff was great!
