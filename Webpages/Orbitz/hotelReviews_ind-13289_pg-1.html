ReviewText:Great affordable hotel in a fantastic section of Boston. Easy to get to everything. n The T was just 2 blocks away. Easy access to running trails along the Charles River Esplanade. We would stay here again.

ReviewText:I was visiting Boston this weekend and stayed at this hotel alone. It has perfect location, really close to subway both red line and blue line, it has a whole foods market right behind the hotel. it would be perfect if the hotel has refrigerator to store the fruit and food i bought from there.

ReviewText:This hotel was the best price in the area for the week. Even though I prepaid, I was offered a higher floor room wIth a view. Close to many good restaurants, Charles/MGH Red line stop and the river paths. Whole Foods is right there if you get tired of eating in restaurants. Don't like the doorless closet but the room was very clean and quiet - even though the elevator was close by. Wireless connection was adequate.
