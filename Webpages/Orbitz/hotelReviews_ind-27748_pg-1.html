ReviewText:I stayed here for business, and for the most part, things were passable. For a highly-rated hotel, there were definitely a few things that were annoying: the cold water wasn't actually cold (room temperature at best), Wi-Fi was expensive and relatively slow (roughly $15/day for 3-4 mbps for "premium" internet access), and the room cleaning was pretty inconsistent - sometimes the garbage was emptied, sometimes it wasn't, and once the things I threw out (some paper cups and a plastic bag) were simply placed on the floor, and the towel levels fluctuated daily. -newline-  -newline- Other than that, everything seemed reasonable. Fine bed, otherwise clean room, power outlets anywhere you might want them, a decent restaurant, and so on. Not a bad hotel, but I may try another the next time I'm in the area.

ReviewText:Some of the staff were very friendly and helpful. When I mentioned the rats to one, she went to some trouble to help me with transportation. She even waived a $2 charge for a bottle of water. -newline-  -newline- The building is dingy but the room was comfortable if not especially clean. Terrific view. Location, apart from the view, is awkward because it is far from any businesses, restaurants, stores, etc. They do have a shuttle that is supposed to run every 10 minutes. It doesn't. You have to call the hotel to get the shuttle to pick you up, and twice they didn't come and I had to take a taxi. The hotel did reimburse me for the taxi. They also refused to take anyone anywhere but Fenway when there was a ball game on. -newline-  -newline- I was given early check in and late check out - this was a big help. -newline-  -newline- The courtyard is nice enough, but the rats are numerous and bold. One ran over my foot. In two days I actually recognized individual rats. Had I stayed any longer I would have given them names! -newline-  -newline- One shuttle driver would not take people where they wanted to go because his shift was almost over. The other one warned me that there were busloads of 'Asian tourists' and to watch out for them. I was shocked at this. -newline-  -newline- I would not stay here again. It is overpriced for the lack of value, and they nickel and dime you to death. It certainly falls far below the standard you expect from a Hyatt Regency.

ReviewText:The Hyatt Regency is centrally located and is within easy walking distance to MIT, Harvard and Boston University. Yet it's far enough away from all the hub-bub so that it doesn't feel as if it's in the middle of a cacophony of city sounds. Rooms are great and service is efficient and friendly.

ReviewText:Excellent hotel. I stayed here for an entire week on a business trip and was very comfortable. It is a little pricey but everything in Boston/Cambridge is expensive compared to my hometown if Detroit.

ReviewText:Fancy & big, as you might expect, with a giant atrium & plenty of amenities. The restaurant that overlooks the Charles. A good launching place for runs or bikes along the Charles -- but far from T-stops, I discovered. They are nice, however, about running you into Central or Harvard Sq. in their van. Efficient & helpful front desk.

ReviewText:If you like it quiet, location is perfect; use shuttle to get to town. Beautiful river views, but there are no cafes or shops near by. It's great to go jogging or biking along the river. Gym and pool very nice.

ReviewText:Nice facilities but was just OK overall. The hotel is a long walk to the T stops. They have a shuttle that will take you to the closest stops, but it is not always reliable and waiting for it wasted a lot of time. So - if you need to get places quickly factor in cab fare for your trip. Also, it was surprising to me that there was no coffee available in the AM in the common areas... free or otherwise. I got some in the restaurant but the staff seemed annoyed with me asking.

ReviewText:We had a wonderful two day stay at the Hyatt Regency in Cambridge, MA. The rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable. The entire hotel was very clean and comfortable. We used the pool and gym facilities which were far above average. We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful, which, coming from New York, pleasantly surprised us. We also took advantage of the restaurant on the premises and were satisfied with the meals provided. However, one of the reasons we ate at the hotel was because the location is a little bit out of the way, requiring a drive or shuttle bus lift to get anywhere in the city of Cambridge or Boston. That being said, the shuttle van was available, which was a positive. I would stay at this hotel again.

ReviewText:I loved the hotel and how they had the REDTARAUNTS on the water.. I wish they had a fridge in the room bc we ordered food a lot or brought food home. Everything there was kind of pricey but it wasn't too big of a deal. Wish they would of let me know that they take 150 out for security reasons bc I possibly could of needed that money while still in Boston. But it loved the set up of the room and I could barely get out of bed bc I was so comfortable! The staff was very pleasant also
