ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location if you're doing the tourist thing. Although if you have a room facing the street it can be loud with traffic and cable car noise. The bathroom was small and the bathtub stained. I'm meticulous about cleanliness and I like being in a hotel that feels well put together and spotless. At Villa Florence, I couldn't help but stare at the dirt and stains in the carpet and imagine its seedy history. The paint on the walls had a caked on feel and you can tell it hadn't been stripped in awhile. Some of the paint had fallen off revealing layers upon layers of previous paint. The duvet for my comforter slipped off revealing stains and general unpleasantness. I was pretty uncomfortable with the cleanliness of my room (actually I was very uncomfortable with the cleanliness of downtown San Francisco) and won't being staying there again, but I have high standards and the place was a great deal given it's location, the hotel restaurant and bar, which are excellent, and the fact that it was high season and still extremely reasonably priced. So if you don't mind some stains and are an easy going person this could be a great place for you.

ReviewText:The location was great. Very near the Powell Street BART station, cable cars and bus stop. Union Square was just a block away. Great access to restaurants and sites. Awesome Tiramisu at the restaurant. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

ReviewText:We have visited SF many times, this time we chose Villa Florence based on my fiance's previous experience during a business trip.  The staff is very friendly and pleasant; however, when my fiance phoned the concierge for a bottle of champagne in the room we were told to bring our own or purchase one from across the street...  The room exceeded my expectations, clean, quiet, well designed and very comfortably bed with many pillows; however, one day the maid left a cleaning rag in our room.  The location can not be beat!  We walked everywhere, shopping, cobb's comedy club, and the ballpark!  We ate at the in house restaurant and it was very good!  Try the cappuccino at the in house bistro, yum!  We will stay here again!

ReviewText:Myself and 6 friends went to SF for the night to spend St Pat's day.  The hotel and staff were excellent.  I have no complaints about any of the staff.  The room was really nice, the bathrooms are just REALLY small.  I don't really mind because I don't go to spend time in my hotel room.  Highly recommend this hotel for location as well.  It couldn't get any better than that!

ReviewText:Great hotel for the price, it's in the heart of union square close to shopping dining and everything. The decor is also really cute. We had a great valentine weekend and the staff was very friendly and accomodating.  Highly recommend it! The only reason I gave it four stars is because it can be a little noisy at night from everything going on in the streets at night, and no hotel parking.  We had to pay $40 a night for our car which I thought was pretty outrageous.

ReviewText:We were very shocked to see the inside of the hotel so nice. The room we got was a 1 king size bed..It was a bit pricey for the small sleeping area. The parking was hard to find we circled the block 2 or 3 times. Over all it was ok
