ReviewText:The first night we stayed was a little loud. The trolley and people yelling outside seemed like they were literally next to us. The next day we asked for them to change our room and they did! We were so happy. It was very quiet. Hotel is great location, its close to restaurants and shopping, and even fishermans warf! -newline- stay there!

ReviewText:I live this part of san francisco. Far enough away from the chaos of union square but close enough to everything with out being right in it. I will definetly be staying here again. There was a pretty surly guy at the front desk but didn't bother me that much because there were two very sweet gals who made up for him!

ReviewText:The hotel is surprisingly hip and has a very cool vibe but it's not overrun with club kids or real kids! -newline-  -newline- All great things to say about this place. Also good to know that they have a Zipcar lot in the hotel. -newline-  -newline- A couple minor downsides... -newline-  -newline- -They have very minimal food choices in the hotel. No room service. You can get a decent breakfast on the go and they have dinner options but no lunch. -newline-  -newline- - You are located up the hill from most places you'll want to do so the walk home can be huge. Use the cablecars! -newline-  -newline- -The gym equipment is totally decent but the gym itself is pretty basic and unappealing. -newline-  -newline- But all and all I would stay here again for sure. It's a safe choice if you are looking at a good price.

ReviewText:We loved staying at the Stanford Court! It was very clean, modern, and they had a great and helpful staff. It is on the very top of Nob Hill so be sure to take a taxi or the trolley up to the hotel, don't try walking it like we did with suitcases and a baby in tow. The rooms were great, very clean, and quiet. They provided a pack and play for our daughter. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is in a very safe and centrally located area, right next to two trolley stops. I would definitely stay here again. On the way back to the airport we had the concierge book us a town car which was well worth it. Also, be sure to stop at the concierge's desk for ideas and advice about what attractions to see and the best way to get around the city. We highly recommend buying the 3 day trolley/bus pass from walgreens. It was around $25 per person. We also did a hop on hop off bus tour that was great, too.

ReviewText:We had a enjoyable weekend in San Francisco. The Stanford Court is next to the Mark Hopkins and across the street from the Fairmont so it is a good neighborhood. Our room was perfectly adequate although not at the standard of the Mark Hopkins where we have also stayed. The decoration room was clean and the bed comfortable but the overall impression of the hotel is that it needs a bit of a refresh. Still it was a good value, the staff was quite friendly, check in was quick and efficient.

ReviewText:The room is definitely good, the hotel had a good location. It was away from the tourism but depending on what you wanted to do it was a little dislocated from the attractions. The shower lacked hot water which was the only downside.

ReviewText:This was our 3rd time to San Fran this month, and by far our best. The hotel was really nice, in the perfect location and with an absolutely gorgeous view of the city. The staff was really friendly and gave us a room on the 8th floor overlooking the entire city. The beds were really clean and super comfortable and the entire room was well laid out and well taken care of. I also liked that they give the first bottle of water in the room for free, that was a nice touch. along with the heated towel rack in the bathroom. The only issue we ran into was parking because they only have valet, but we found a self park about 3 blocks down which was very cheap compared to how much the hotel was charging. overall I was very impressed with the hotel and would recommend others to stay here.
