ReviewText:We picked this hotel due to the location. It is close to Macys and other shops . The price is expensive but comparable to the other hotels in the area. The rooms are extremely small but it was only 2 of us so we managed. We did not use the valet service since we decided to use the parking structure under Union Square. Valet is $50+ with in/out privileges but the Union Square parking garage charges $34 a day with no in/out privileges. Since we stayed local we used this instead. Our room did not have a view but it didn't really matter. Other than that I would stay here again since all of the hotels are basically the same.

ReviewText:The hotel was in a great location for walking, public transit and ferries. Shopping abounded as did restaurants. The king size bed was a little "slanty" on one side. The room toiletries were mediocre and there was no bathrobe. It was a little too close to the ice machine. One had to pay for wi-fi in the room although it was free in the lobby...they also charged for local calls which I found to be unnecessary and cheapened the experience.

ReviewText:Expensive! Friendly and helpful staff. Nice rooms with high ceilings and chandelier. Not much of a view from our room. They have a stocked bar in the room but no refrigerator so have to order one to be brought to the room. It was tacky. No swimming pool or sauna but a beautiful work out area. Dining/breakfast room was good but need to be cleaned more thoroughly. Need better maintenance on their common area ex.. ice machine room. In our bathroom the shower handle fell off and the stopper in the sink did not work properly. Maintenance did come and resolve the issues in the room but the door to the ice machine room was still in disrepair when we left. -newline- Would like to compare other hotels in the area. The location was unbeatable and I felt safe. -newline- Maybe we just got a bum room. -newline- I recommend this hotel with limitations.

ReviewText:Friendly and capable staff, good restaurants, solid room service, and comfortable rooms with reasonable Internet access. My caveat is that the walls are pretty thin.
