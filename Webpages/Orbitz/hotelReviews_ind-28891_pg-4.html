ReviewText:The staff was great, the room was nice, I didn't like that they charged for internet access and the valet service was $20 more per day than parking it myself 1/2 block away.

ReviewText:An absolutely wonderful hotel--swanky, friendly and attentive staff, the room was beautiful (with a wonderful view--I was on the 22nd floor), and the RESTAURANT (just reopened after major remodeling) is FABULOUS. I had a breakfast date with a friend one morning but went to the hotel in-house first because the food is divine, then just had coffee with my friend later. My traveling companion had the same response--wonderful, wonderful hotel. I would look for an excuse to come to San Francisco just to stay here again.

ReviewText:Wonderful. We wanted a fun getaway for our anniversary and that's what we got. Rooms were new and clean. Views were awesome. John the concierge treated us very nice. Location was perfect. Didn't need a car at all. Still doing construction but didn't bother us at all. Everyone was great.

ReviewText:Can't beat the location to Union Square, great food and shopping all around and only a few short blocks from BART station. Rooms well appointed and fantastic views of the city and bay from the lounge upstairs. Will definitely stay again.

ReviewText:Staff were very helpful and professional. Bed was comfortable. Room was clean. they were currently working on lobby renovations- had just finished renovating rooms; however, bathroom fan didn't work. Our room came with free breakfast, which was the breakfast buffet. Food was excellent- several meat options, eggs, fruit, cheese, bread/ pastries, yogurt, oatmeal. Wait staff were excellent- always there to refill your coffee or juice. Location convenient to all shopping stores. we were on the 14th floor- could hear street noise saturday night/ early sun morning- (however, beyond hotels control). i would stay here again.

ReviewText:Stayed two nights for pleasure. Room is great. No real view but panoramic and nice. Quiet end room. Only used room service which was good. Don't know if its their restaurant food, which I read terribly reviews on but ours was fine and dessert really good. Nice size. Excellent location convenient to Union Square, financial district, walkable to bus train subway cable cars... price is good for the area, great value for the area. Oh and they were booked but allowed us free late checkout. Front door guys are awesome and go out of their way for you, held our luggage while we walked around after checkout. Counter people were friendly as well. Limo/taxi front door service.
