ReviewText:This was not a planned trip but for the price I got more than I expected. This Marriott is kinda hidden amongst the other fancy hotels downtown but the folk there made the most of it. Personable and helpful. Located next to a wonderful mall and the Street Car line I enjoyed the personal attention and felt Safe as well. Availability of Transportation and food was excellent. Might just hang out here again by myself just for the fun of it. I really felt like i was at home away from home. Liked it..

ReviewText:This is an average highrise hotel surrounded by other average highrise hotels in an excellent location on Mission and 4th. My husband and I were in SF for Pride, and the location really is fantastic. We fit us and our 3 kids into one comfortable room and were not unexpectedly cramped. Unfortunately upon checking in our bathroom sink didn't drain and it took the hotel 2 days to repair it. A day and a half to respond to the problem, and a few hours of repair work. It was also pretty poor form to turn over the room starting at 1400, only to proceed at a glacial pace. It took two people an hour to make the beds and vacuum.

ReviewText:Visited, accompanied by my son and daughter-in-law, to spend time with family members from Singapore who were staying in SFO. Marriott's central location made for ease in traveling to them as well as to Muir Woods, California Jewish Museum (within walking distance), and other locales on our list. Hotel staff was most accommodating, arranging for food to be delivered to my room even after the posted room service hours, and to providing me with and storing a wheelchair for me during my stay.
