ReviewText:My husband and I stayed here for one night. When we got to our room there were two double beds. I called the front desk and requested a king bed. The room we had faced the city and was an ok view. The front desk preceded to tell me that it was the way I booked And I kept telling him I was never given the option to choose. You would think that seeing a couple they would at least ask at the front desk. After some debate the front desk gentlemen told me to wait in the hall and not touch anything in the room. He came up and escorted us to a different room, opened the door and left immediately. When we opened the curtains we were blocked by another building and view of a roof. It was awful. The bed was also not comfortable for a 4 star hotel and the prices they charge. I like the intercontinental brand and have stayed in other locations but this one lacked service all around. Not happy.

ReviewText:The room was very spacious and clean. The tv was larger than average and a great view. It was located right on the water which was nice. Lots of great restaurants right nearby. The concierge, Jessica was very helpful in finding dining options for us. -newline- The bathroom was great, with a large tub and separate shower.

ReviewText:Stayed here over the weekend for 4 days for a business trip. Hotel is very nice, and has that luxurious feel. It's like staying at a Four Seasons, but not really. Amenities are great, the room was fantastic. Really beautiful. I got a waterfront view and the location and views cannot be beat. I really wanted to give this hotel a 5 but the staff/service colored my review. The staff is very cold and doesn't seem to care very much about the clients. I'm pretty easygoing but if you are a hotel of this caliber you must make sure your staff and service is buttoned up. For instance, I got in late, super tired from my flight, and struggling w/ my luggage and the doorman asked me "do you need help with that?" Obviously I do! And isn't that your job anyway to help the clients coming into the hotel and take their luggage? I've just come back from Chicago and stayed at a boutique hotel and their service there is impeccable. The next day, I left for meetings and came back at 3pm and my room still hasn't been cleaned. I called front desk to ask if it will be cleaned and she said yes. 20 minutes later housekeeping knocks and I told her I will leave the room in 15 minutes for another meeting. She gave me attitude and said "so will I. I need to leave in 15 minutes." That was so rude in my opinion. Then they didn't even take out my used coffee cup or replenished my sugar packets and cream, etc. I know these are little things but they matter especially in the early morning when you're rushing to work and need that first cup of coffee. Finally when I was checking out, they told me I had a charge from the bar downstairs when I didn't even visit that bar or ordered any drinks to my room! So annoying! They eventually took my word for it and took out the charge. But it's the little things like that that makes someone's stay frustrating. All in all, I'd recommend for the location, room and amenities but not for the service.

ReviewText:I stayed for one evening at the Intercontinental Boston and loved it. The concierge was so friendly and accomodating during my stay, and the staff from check-in to room service were all exceptionally friendly! The gym was filled with state of the art equipment, and a gorgeous indoor pool. On-site restaurants such as Miel are gorgeous with a great menu. Right across from the Boston Tea Party museum, and within walking distance of most of the sights to see in Boston, the Intercontinental is a luxurious must-stay!

ReviewText:I stayed at the InterContinental for one night for business and the hotel was beatiful, in a good location, but the service I received was really what would get me to book this hotel again. -newline-  -newline- I ended up coming down with some sort of flu during my stay at the InterContinental, and called down to room service for crackers and ginger ale. The woman that I spoke with was very considerate, and had room service bring up 6-8 glass bottles of ginger ale and crackers in less than 5 minutes. -newline-  -newline- I assumed I would see an additional charge for the $36-$65 added to my bill since the mini bar charged from $6-$8 per bottle of soda...but to my surprise, I was not charged. -newline-  -newline- It's that type of service and consideration of the staff that sets a hotel apart from others. I have recommended this hotel to others staying in Boston and will continue to recommend it due to the service that I received.

ReviewText:I stayed at the InterContinental while attending a conference in Boston. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. The room was more than I expected for the price and the location was perfect. I do wish the hotel had free WiFi but I was able to use the mobile hot spot feature on my phone with no trouble. I would definitely recommend this hotel in the future.
