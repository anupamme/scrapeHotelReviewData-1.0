ReviewText:When I booked this hotel, It stated it was a double room overlooking the river. Upon checking in, I was told I would have to pay an extra $30 to get a room overlooking the river. The man checking us in was rude, and acted like we didn't belong in such a nice hotel. He told us abruptly that the pool was closed, but that we could use the pool in a different hotel, if the shuttle bus had time to take us there, as there were other guests needing the service that would take priority. In all, it just wasn't a great experience. Most of the staff seemed miserable and didn't communicate at all. I would not stay here again.

ReviewText:Beautiful hotel, ok customer service. Was shocked that they charged for absolutely everything, 25 dollars a night was ridiculous enough, but when leaving it turned out to be 35 dollars. We got an ok deal to stay there, but in the end turned out not to be worth it.

ReviewText:A good hotel worth a price of about 100 per night. Room is clean is relatively large, staffs are amicable and services are good. However there is no fridge in the room so I can't put my fruits in the room for a night and I have to eat them all before I sleep. But the shower is really good I really love the shower.
