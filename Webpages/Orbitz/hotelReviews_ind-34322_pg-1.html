ReviewText:Loved the hotel and the location. I want to give a shout out to Nate, the concierge. I've never had better service at a hotel. Nate set up an amazing weekend for me and was somehow able to get reservations at restaurants that I thought were sold out. Thanks for a great weekend.

ReviewText:We stayed one night at The Lenox in Boston and it was fabulous. The staff was incredibly friendly and eager to help us in every way. The room was clean and spacious. We will surely stay here again in the future!

ReviewText:We wanted to visit Boston as neither of us had been previously. We chose the Lenox based on reviews and its location in Back Bay. Nothing was too difficult to get to. The staff were excellent at all times and helped us to get the most out of our 6 days in the city. The bottom line says about recommending to a friend - yes, with reservations. The reservation being that I wouldn't want so many of them to book that I can't get a reservation!

ReviewText:Awesome location, the rest is not worth the price. Staff is trying to be helpful, but extremely inexperienced...For example, had my bag stuck to another car that almost left with it when the were "helping" unload my car.. Had to wait for the bag to be brought up to the room 20 minutes and make 2 calls...

ReviewText:Great hotel in a perfect Back Bay location - near trains, Copley Square, Mapparium, and so much more. The room was super quiet - never heard anyone on either side! The staff was wonderful and couldn't be any more helpful. They thought of everything - including a huge list of things you might have forgotten that they will provide free, from toothpaste to nail polish remover and nail clippers!! Our room even had an umbrella. Loved the restaurant where we enjoyed great breakfasts each morning. Will always return to this hotel whenever I'm in Boston!!!

ReviewText:Incredible accomodations, location, friendly staff, Room Service, City Table Restaurant. Only negative would be noise level. Street noise and Hotel Event noise heard very loudly on 3rd Floor. Would suggest asking for higher floor and away from elevator if you are light sleeper.

ReviewText:Extremely well located for business and leisure. -newline- Staff service is unbeatable. Word NO does not exist there. Bars and restaurants good and frequented by locals ( says a lot about it) -newline- It is worth of it. In all aspects, even though not cheap.

ReviewText:The hotel has a very nice boutique touch and the staff there make you feel welcomed as soon as you walk through the door. We had a free upgrade upon arrival and complimentary snack basket is included in the room (love the Kiehl's toiletries btw). The location couldn't be any better (a trip to Newbury St is a must!) and subway station is cross the road from the hotel. The staff are friendly, helpful and professional. Love it and will def recommend.
