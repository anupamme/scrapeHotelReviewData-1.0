ReviewText:After staying in the Union Square area for years, we decided to try a different part of town. This hotel is situated perfectly, on the Embarcadero and right across from the Ferry Building. Check-in was super fast and we were offered an upgrade to a corner room for $50. Awesome view of the Ferry Building and waterfront. We'll definitely stay here next time!

ReviewText:We chose to stay at Hotel Vitale for the last couple days of our Honeymoon in San Francisco. The front desk offered us an upgrade and we LOVED our room. All the details matter....the linens, light fixtures, shower, couch, "fresh" toiletries....it felt like a spa. With a couple hours, someone delivered a bottle of Champagne for us with a "congratulations" card signed by the staff members individually. This was above and beyond! -newline- Everyone was prompt and attentive, the room service breakfast was pricey, but good. The restaurant was very busy due to an event, but we enjoyed our service at the bar. The best part is that its located on the water and you can get anywhere on the Embarcadero very quickly. The only thing I felt was missing was drawer/dresser space and some kind of pool/jacuzzi. -newline- Otherwise, I would stay at this hotel if I visited San Fran again and I have already recommended it to several people.

ReviewText:This was a super location. The Embarcadero area is nice and new. It was a very do-able walk to Union Square for shopping. The Ferry building is a fun place to stroll through and/or eat. The embarcadero is a great , safe, scenic place to walk. We never had to use our car or a taxi. We ate at the Boulevard and the Epic Steakhouse. Both were within a short walk and the food/service was amazing. Apparently the ocean view room at the Vitale do not have a bath tub, only a spa shower. The shower was wonderful and the view was a good tradeoff for the tub. There was coffee in the lobby or from room service, but we prefer to brew our own the way we like it when we like it. All the staff was exceptional, especially the main bellman. Also, I like the hotel because it is not a high rise.

ReviewText:Located on the Embarcadero within walking distance of the historic Ferry Building, the Hotel Vitale is a San Francisco gem.  The staff goes out of its way to be courteous, attentive and accomodating.  The rooms are spacious and well-appointed.  The restaurant and spa facilities are excellent.  My only reluctance in offering even more superlatives is that I don't want the Vitale to become so widely popular that it loses its special charm.
