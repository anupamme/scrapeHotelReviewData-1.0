ReviewText:We got to the hotel straight from the airport on Sat. afternoon a few hours before check-in. This wonderful girl I wish I would've gotten her name had our room ready within minutes. Lizbeth from housekeeping came everyday to clean and change towels. The hotel sits across from the TD Gardens and right next to several bars. So after a Bruins or Celtics game expect a loud party late into the night. This wasn't a problem for my husband and I. The hotel is also very close to the North Station where you can take the train anywhere you need to go. We went to Fenway for a game and the Boylston Fire Station. We walked to the Science museum for the Duck tours then went back the next day for the omni. This hotel will be where we will be staying from now on. Oh an in the mornings expect to be awakened by seagulls instead of roosters like we do back home! Ha Thank you Holiday Inn Express

ReviewText:This hotel is decent, great for 1 night after an event at the garden. Clean, friendly staff, and valet parking. Rooms are TINY, and it is really overpriced.

ReviewText:We were here for a weekend and it was a great time. The room was impeccable, it was close to the gahdin, train line and other fun stuff. Beware though, the noise from the street can sometimes be heard in your room. But i didnt care because i was drunk.

ReviewText:The hotel was hard to find, even though Friend St. is only a couple short blocks. Lots of one way streets and alleys that are hard to maneuver. I called the hotel to ask how to get there. Even though I was only 2 blocks away, the front desk clerk, reading a map, did not seem to know her way around Boston and it took another clerk and 15-20 minutes to help us drive around in circles (during rush hour) to get back to the hotel. The room was well appointed with a small fridge, microwave, coffee maker (1 cup, should be 2), sink, cabinets with paper plates, etc. Room was big enough for 2 adults and 3 children (sofa bed & 2 doubles, desk & huge closet) but was still a little small to get around. We found 3 toys in the room, so it was apparently not cleaned very well. Coffee in the lobby was not very tasty.

ReviewText:The location was excellent, right across the street from the TD Garden in the North End. The design of the hotel was very Ikea. The condition of the room was fair. Although the spare pillow in the closet did have a hair on it which tells me it wasnt washed. All other sheets and pillows looked fine.

ReviewText:This hotel was good overall and I'd stay there again. The only real downside was that our room was exceptionally hot, but it wasn't bad enough for us to actually complain. Location is really very good, many great restaurants, easy 30 minute train ride to airport and close to plenty of Boston locations.
