ReviewText:This was a good spot for a stopover - Seattle is a great city and the Monaco is a nice hotel. However, check the location of the room in relation to the ice supply room as mine was right next door and attracted a lot of traffic and noisy ice dispensing on Friday and Saturday night. Being woken every half hour or so until the early hours by the crashing of ice into metal buckets and drunken laughing gives you bags under your eyes. Its 'quirkiness' is a bit try-hard as well; but will probably appeal to some.

ReviewText:We stayed here for our wedding and my first time in Seattle so we wanted to see the sights. Everything was so close to the hotel that we could walk. -newline- Only draw back was there is no pool.

ReviewText:The hotel had a nice and creative lobby. The room was a suite and it offered 2 televisions. The hotel was quiet but located in the heart of downtown Seattle. You could walk to many place and if you walked outside to the corner left or right of the building you could see the water. Overall the hotel stay was very nice but a the restaurant In the hotel was quite pricey and the refrigerator items and other room available in the room was way to expensive. I would stay here again for the downtown location and the 5 o'clock happy hour of wine they select in red and white. Also on Thursday and Saturday they have a live,performer for the happy hour. It gets pretty crowded in the lobby so you want to go down early if you want a seat. If they offered free breakfast included with the hotel they would always get continuous business for sure.

ReviewText:This hotel was very nice! Super close to everything, easy to walk around and see it all, and had great views as well as service. They were great to my daughter and even brought a goldfish to the room for her to enjoy. Room service was quick and good as well. The doormen were awesome- gave great ideas of things to do nearby as well as in the surrounding areas. The only drawback was the parking fees- it cost as much to rent a car as it did to parl. If you don;t need to drive anywhere, just shuttle in to the hotel and walk/can around instead. Great nearby attractions included the Space Needle, Pike Place, Beechers, all kinds of food options, the Chihuly glass exhibit, the ferries, EMP museum, art museum-- just so much to choose from.

ReviewText:I love it when a hotel actually lives up to the pictures and descriptions on their website. This is a really nice, little hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff. The Hotel Monaco was probably the highlight of our trip. Everyone from the valets, to the desk staff, to the room service staff were lovely and really seemed to enjoy their jobs (other than one person who answered the front desk phone, when I called to ask for an additional towel. She said she would "be happy to do that," but, her tone said otherwise. I want to end on a positive note, however, and say that we would definitely stay at Hotel Monaco, again, if we are ever back in Seattle. P.S. The food from room service was delicious, and arrived piping hot.
