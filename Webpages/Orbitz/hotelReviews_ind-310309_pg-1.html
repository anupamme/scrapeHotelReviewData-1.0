ReviewText:I recently made a short trip to Texarkana, Texas. I wanted to be away from the weekend traffic. I stayed in this hotel, although I was leary but I was very pleased. The room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The personnel were very nice and accommodating. Very surprised with the 42" flat screen, refrigerator and microwave. Excellent maid service. Very close to restaurants, fast food and gas station.Well worth the 20 minute drive from the airport. I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:Noting that this review is based on relative value against other 2-star establishments. The staff was friendly and competent, public areas clean and well kept, breakfast included fresh waffles and good coffee, wi-fi internet access was excellent, and the room air conditioning worked very well. Bedding was clean and comfortable. Stayed two nights and would do so again if coming back to the area.

ReviewText:This was a great place to stay.  Beds were very comfortable.  Staff was helpful and friendly.  It was right on the interstate right in the area I was looking to stay.  However, call this hotel in person and set up the stay. [...]

ReviewText:Hotel was easily accessible from Interstate. Room was clean upon arrival, but housekeeping did not change linens or empty trash next day. Non-smoking room was truly a non-smoking room...big plus! Overall, our stay was great and I would stay there again. I would recommend it to others. Great room and stay for the price.
