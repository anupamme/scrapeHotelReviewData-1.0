ReviewText:The hotel was older and advertised a bar and restaurant, however the bar and restaurant was actually not in the hotel but next door. The food and service was good but I have to admit as as ingle woman I was a bit leary about going over to it. The hotel was also noisy the night go my stay.

ReviewText:I wanted a clean room, good for kids and grandparents, location to downtown and under $100 with breakfast and pool. I got clean and good for everybody, with really friendly and responsive staff, restaurant right next door to lobby with great breakfast (usually charge $9 but because there's not actually a pool - like the Orb site shows a picture of!! - and the desk clerk said it hadn't been open in over a year but that they were trying to locate all references in these sites to a pool and cull them out - I asked what could he do to make me happy, since I wouldn't have come if not for the pool - and he offered us all free breakfast, which was fantastic! I really appreciated this and well adid. It's a great breakfast.# it was also a bit cool in the room for summer but they brought up 3 blankets prompltly and then the man came right back with a little heater. the bed was really soft and comy which I love, kids slept great. Very clean and I talked to the maintenance /engineering guy in the elevator- he was clearly on a mission as part of what seems to be a regular upkeep program and he was all nicely uniformed and I wa really impressed. PLUS the lobby is really nicely decorated and it gives a great first impression. The price was not all that bad - I was happy paying what I did #$120 i think). We had a good time there and would have stayed longer if we could. Very effeicient check out. Cleaning ladies very friendly, got a chance to practice my spanish. Well done! Thank you.

ReviewText:I did not feel this hotel was worth the almost 200 dollars a night we paid to stay here. Cockroaches in room. Had something taken from our room. Everything in the room was cheap. Closet doors kept sliding off hinges. Things like that. I would never stay there again. The pool was closed during my entire visit.
