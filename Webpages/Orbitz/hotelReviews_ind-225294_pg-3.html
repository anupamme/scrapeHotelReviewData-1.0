ReviewText:Villa Florence doesn't miss a beat. Every employee we encountered gave us 5 star service. I'm definitely staying at Villa Florence on my next trip to SF. It's only 2 blocks from the BART station. I love this hotel.

ReviewText:Pleasant small room with a tiny bathroom. Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. Culetos, the associated restaurant was excellant. The location and its proximity to theatres and downtown make this a very attractive place to stay.

ReviewText:The room, bathroom are too small and uncomfortable, the lobbies smell like a nursing home/assisted living/convalescence hospital. The carpet is old/expired/ugly. -newline- But the hotel staff is very friendly and compensates the other minuses.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location if you're doing the tourist thing. Although if you have a room facing the street it can be loud with traffic and cable car noise. The bathroom was small and the bathtub stained. I'm meticulous about cleanliness and I like being in a hotel that feels well put together and spotless. At Villa Florence, I couldn't help but stare at the dirt and stains in the carpet and imagine its seedy history. The paint on the walls had a caked on feel and you can tell it hadn't been stripped in awhile. Some of the paint had fallen off revealing layers upon layers of previous paint. The duvet for my comforter slipped off revealing stains and general unpleasantness. I was pretty uncomfortable with the cleanliness of my room (actually I was very uncomfortable with the cleanliness of downtown San Francisco) and won't being staying there again, but I have high standards and the place was a great deal given it's location, the hotel restaurant and bar, which are excellent, and the fact that it was high season and still extremely reasonably priced. So if you don't mind some stains and are an easy going person this could be a great place for you.
