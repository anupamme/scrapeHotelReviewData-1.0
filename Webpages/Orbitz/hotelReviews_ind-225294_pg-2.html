ReviewText:I chose this hotel based on: -newline- * location to BART/SF Muni (it's a couple blocks away) -newline- * location to union square (it's across the street) -newline- * free WiFi -newline- On those things, I wasn't disappointed. The street is a bit noisy. It's on the Trolley line, and there are lots of street performers. So if you can, get one of the upper stories. The first night on the 4th floor, we needed earplugs. We were fine after that. -newline-  -newline- Their WiFi is slow... but gets the job done. The hotel is beautiful, and rooms comfy. It's tricky to find the first time. It's wedged between a restaurant and a store. -newline-  -newline- I didn't want to drive, and there's lots of public transport options... and a bike rental place across the street, which was a great way for us to get around and see the city. -newline-  -newline- We got a SF CityPass, which gave us free rides on the Trolley for the week... a great way to get to Pier 39. It's a good deal for this hotel, with the trolley passing right by. -newline-  -newline- Parking is $50/day, I'd recommend using public transport instead, if you stay here. That rate is pretty common near Union Square.

ReviewText:Average hotel, best for it's location and that's what you are paying for. Small room, but clean and comfortable and adequate for a couple. No double-glazing therefore street noise audible if in a front-facing room. Quieter rooms available away from the street, but the window in those rooms would face another building. Did not provide teabags in the room, only coffee. Staff very friendly and helpful. Also liked that CO Bigelow toiletries were provided in room.

ReviewText:The staff were great, super nice people, not stuffy or fake in any way. made some changes/increases at our request and were very reasonable. The hotel location is perfect for us, right in the middle of the action. -newline-  -newline- The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 as in all hotels not enough outlets for all of our electronic stuff. The TV volume when turned on came on full blast then went to a normal volume. -newline-  -newline- I will stay there again. -newline-  -newline- I

ReviewText:Needed a small get away. The room was great. The staff was friendly. The hotel was beautiful. It's small, but it's an old SF building so it makes sense. -newline-  -newline- A little overpriced for the size, but again, you're paying to be in the middle of downtown.
