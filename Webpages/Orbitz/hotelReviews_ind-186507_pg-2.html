ReviewText:son was really sick and waited for an hour for a plunger. silly as it seems you wait 15 minutes then another...go downstairs to find they have no idea what your talking about. -newline- i asked for a place that included parking but $41,00 later ....for the variance in price I probably could have upgraded to a better hotel for a little more money....it was ok but could have been cleaner.

ReviewText:Price was great for a Long Weekend! I've had better complimentary breakfasts, but when in San Fran, you better be heading out on the town to eat anyways. Very small and cozy rooms. Nothing special. No issues or problems really. Bed was a little hard, same with pillows. But they were happy to bring us more softer pillows upon request. I'd stay here again. I'd rather spend the saved money on eating then on luxurious overnight stays since really only sleeping at the hotel and out on the town the rest of the day.

ReviewText:We were presently surprised by the quality of the hotel and staff. The hotel is near the tenderloin section of SFO that has been somewhat savory. However, that seems to be changing as renovation and good restaurants are in the area.

ReviewText:Our college age son stayed here overnight because it's close to the Spanish consulate where he had to get his visa. He was pick pocketed and the hotel staff went above and beyond to help him out. He said the area of town was sort of sketchy, though.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a convenient location but definitely in a sketchier neighbourhood. The staff was professional and beds were comfortable.

ReviewText:The hotel looks and feels a little tired. The room is small and does not have that fresh clean feeling but was clean enough I suppose. The thermostat was new, but did not let you keep the fan circulating. At least the window opened (onto an alley) to let in fresh air (and city noise). The bathroom ventilation was also a window, but obviously you didn't want to leave that open while you were using it. The mattresses were a little squeaky. The neighborhood looks a little sketchy, although the hotel does sit on a N-S and E-W bus line so that is a plus. But give yourself a good 30 minutes on the bus to get to the fisherman's wharf area. The bus stops at every intersection and you could probably walk faster than the bus (except for the steep hills). The staff was helpful - they gave us softer pillows after the first night (the original ones were hard and flat) and they let us park for the old price of $33/night (they had just raised it to $55). The continental breakfast was adequate (I've had much worse). They also had a wine and cheese hour one evening. Oh, and they did have a coin operated washer / dryer by the exercise room in the basement which was handy. We were there for a family vacation so this probably wasn't the best option.
