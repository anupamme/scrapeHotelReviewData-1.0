ReviewText:I chose this hotel mainly due to the good reviews and location. I was not disappointed! -newline-  -newline- The room was HUGE and very clean. Everything was in mint condition and well maintained. I couldn't have asked for more. -newline-  -newline- The location is great if you want to check out down down Seattle. You can pretty much just walk to all of the main areas. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay here again!

ReviewText:Our trip to Seattle kicked off with a bang after checking in to the Alexis and seeing our suite. The bellhops and other staff were about the best I've ever encountered - very helpful, attentive, and knowledgable about their city.

ReviewText:Everyone is very helpful and friendly. I stayed at the Fireplace Suite for 2 nights and it was immaculate. The location is ideal for tourists. The fitness room is pretty small though, only 1 treadmill and a few free weights. As everyone else states, the parking fee is 40/night but other than that no negatives about my stay

ReviewText:I was looking for a good value in proximity to where I was having a meeting, and took them up on their discounted rate. Not only was it walking distance from the light rail (direct line from SeaTac) it was accommodating in every manner. The wine tasting, bath robe, and staff courtesy were well worth the rate. I will return! --Oh, and if you have pets, they serve pets with no additional charge.

ReviewText:We stayed at the Alexis for a one-night escape from Tacoma in the big city. The location was perfect, a short walk to Pike's Place, Pioneer Square and the waterfront. The room was beautiful and comfortable, if not the most spacious, and the private steamroom available for reservation without extra charge is lovely. The late checkout time (noon) is also nice, allowing a leisurely and stress-free return to real life.

ReviewText:Just spent a girls weekend away at the Alexis in Seattle. Staff was very helpful, Keith the concierge made reservations for us at a great spa with only few days notice and they always made sure we had directions to where we were going before we headed out. For some reason we got a handicap accessible room but it was beautiful, roomy with a big bathroom. I will stay there again if I go back to Seattle.
