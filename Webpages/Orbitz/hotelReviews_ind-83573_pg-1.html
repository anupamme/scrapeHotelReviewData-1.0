ReviewText:We came here for one night to attend an Outside Lands concert. Hotels during this time was extremely expensive so I was happy to find anything for less than $300. (I understand that at non-peak times that hotel would be considered affordable.) -newline-  -newline- Breakdown: -newline- Room: it was small, would only fit two small adults but the bed was comfy. -newline- View: The room we were in had no view (actually view of the fire escape). -newline- Front desk: they were wonderful and helpful.

ReviewText:Good location, near many restaurants, near Embarcadero and movies. Friendly staff, Perry's has good food. Only downside was the $40 extra for parking after I thought I was to get free parking.

ReviewText:This Hotel should be selected for the location. The room we were assigned #408 was below average at best. There is a club of some sort which goes on pretty late on Saturday nights. Staff was A++. But for the price #408 was disappointing.

ReviewText:My husband and I walk extensively in San Francisco and the location of the hotel is perfect for this. The staff were very friendly and accomadating. The room had every necessity, which functioned well,but was tiny, so good for sleeping , not lounging. It's an old building and therefore musty smelling, and the ventilation was insufficient. That being said, would stay again as an overnight in the future as it is a good value

ReviewText:The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We had never been to San Fran and the staff did a good job pointing us in the right direction. The room itself was great; a tad small but very clean. Best overall hotel experience I've ever had. If recommend this place to the queen of England. -newline-  -newline- Also, the restaurant staff were top notch. Good food too.

ReviewText:Small rooms with no window to speak of. Tried 2 rooms due to noise ...first one opposite ice machine then asked for quieter room...given one next to stairs! Noise every night after restaurant closed......for a,week! Coffee in rooms is very weak....had to take coffees from lobby to get a decent drink. -newline- Good location and friendly staff does not make up for a week of small, noisy room.

ReviewText:Need I say more? The toilet would not flush even 1 Kleenex. A day after it was fixed, the same problem. The coffee cup in the room was chipped. We left it out, and it was put back to still use - chipped. My husband's toe bled on the bathroom floor. Housekeeping never cleaned it up although it was very obvious. There was dirt/rust behind the the toilet that was there all nights we were there. There were 2 of us in the room; they gave us 1 small bottle of water per day. Do not expect a bay view unless u book directly with the hotel. And, the front desk person was rude and looked down on us because we did not pay full price with the hotel. -newline-  -newline- The sink is in the bedroom. When you use the toilet, you cannot wash your hands before opening the bathroom door, and perhaps touching other things like the turning off the bathroom light. How unsanitary is that? -newline-  -newline- The place advertises a 0 waste policy. It is plain cheap.
