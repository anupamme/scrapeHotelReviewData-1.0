ReviewText:We love the managers reception and free breakfast. Its close to Seaport Village and the harbor. Great view of the city and bay. Negative aspects are no free wi-fi, expensive valet parking.

ReviewText:This hotel was a great pick for my kids and me. Very well located with easy access to everything via car, public transportation and walking. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. They were engaged and enjoying their roles. Slow drain in the shower and $35/night parking fee were the only two disappointments. However, I would stay here again due to the overall experience here and the great location.

ReviewText:The hotel is nice and the location is great for what we needed. The breakfast buffet was a mob scene. Does everyone in San Diego come here to eat breakfast? The other disappointing thing is who are the special people that get to stay in higher floors? I called the hotel to request after booking through an online booking company. The hotel said the online booking company had to request it, which they did on my behalf. At check in, we were put on the 4th floor of a 12 or so story hotel and told there weren't any higher available. Dropping $1,600 for six nights should get us better than that.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location and very comfortable, The valet area is smalll and we had to wait every time we came or went with our car. The nice thing is you really don't need a car at this location since there is so much to do with-in walking distance.

ReviewText:location is excellent. Near Seaport village. A quick walk along the water to tourist spots, including the ferry to get to Coronado. A quick drive to the zoo. Nice size room. Excellent reception nightly as well as a great breakfast. -newline- Our only complaint was our 17 year old who slept on the hide a bed. It was uncomfortable
