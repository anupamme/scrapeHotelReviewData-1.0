ReviewText:Location is good,only 2 blocks from Windansea Beach. Room normal but bath old and ceiling squeaked when person upstairs walks.First night bad guest upstairs with TV noise at 1:30. I spoke with man but still had to get night manager to resolve issue. Nice pool area and oversudsy spa. Nearby restaurants look suspiciously dirty. Breakfast simple but take it to room,no tables but benches outside facing parking lot.Much better experience at Thousand Oaks Travel Lodge. Only 2-3 miles to center of town, shopped,ate,enjoyed sea air, but not into seals.

ReviewText:Overall recommended - big room with TV, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, basic breakfast included. Only a few minutes from Windansea beach and 5min drive to La Jolla downtown. Comparably cheap for pricey La Jolla, but still quite a lot for a Motel6/Super8-like place.

ReviewText:A well-mannered welcome by the hotel's receptionists was very nice. A perfect location, only half a block of walk to the beach. A very comfortable room with all necessities ready for use. My wife and I would definitely like to come back and stay here.

ReviewText:I read some negative reviews but overall the experience for me was a positive one for me & my girls. -newline- *glows: the place is a bit rundown but very well kept, our room was very clean with plenty of towels. Cleaning was done on schedule and the hotel was a block away from some beautiful beaches! -newline- *grows: breakfast was served in the front office and no place to sit, parking was limited.

ReviewText:For the price not bad, staff excellent, I would stay on the second floor next time, too noisy on the first and people slam the doors until midnight, not very courtous from them! -newline- Was ok, for an extra 40 $ you can upgrade hotels

ReviewText:The Travelodge in La Jolla is a simple motel, but it is comfortable and very affordable for the LJ neighborhood! The room is small and basic, but met our needs. The staff is friendly and efficient and the location is very convenient to the beach and to the commercial areas of La Jolla.
