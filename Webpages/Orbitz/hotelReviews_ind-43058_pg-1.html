ReviewText:The rooms are very well maintained, very well cleaned and refreshing. The complimentary breakfast did not have any room to eat in, only a few chairs outside. We had to take our breakfast back to our rooms. There was an adequate supply of breakfast items, but no eggs of any kind, only carbs.

ReviewText:Compared to the prices of the other hotels in the vicinity, I didn't expect much from this hotel. I was happy with the cleanliness, the bed and how close it was to the beach. The room was small and the bathroom was small. But for me and my girlfriend it was a place to lay our heads. It was ideal.

ReviewText:The hotel is little bit old from outside and even inside. Also the bathroom is so small and old style. -newline- The only good thing is the location is perfect because it only take you 3 minutes walk to the beach.

ReviewText:We decided to visit La Jolla for a few days and couldn't be more happy with our visit. The staff was very friendly. The hotel is located within a five minute walk from a small beach. It is also walking distance to a few local restaurants. I will likely stay here again.

ReviewText:For a two star hotel, this was adequate. Coffee maker, hair dryer, clean. Rooms are small and just one bed that I think was a full and not even queen. But, people were nice. There is a pool and hot tub, and the hotel is close to everything La Jolla for a decent price. I would go back.

ReviewText:Good value with all basic necessities covered. The room I had was spacious with two closets, perfect for our group of 3. Most important of all, the place was clean and seemed well maintained.
