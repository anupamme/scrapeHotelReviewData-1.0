ReviewText:Hotel staff was awesome and shuttle that is included with hotel is worth the stay alone. The hotel shuttle goes to Pike's Market , the Space Needle, Pioneer Square and a few other places. It was very convenient and we did not need to rent a car. The rooms were very nice and we had a beautiful view of Elliott Bay. The Mariners baseball stadium is just across the street and Century Field where Seahawk Football is played is right next door to baseball stadium. The staff could not have been nicer and more helpful. If you stay at hotel during game times it can be a litlte noisy but we were at the games so it was perfect for us. I would highly recommend any of the Silver Cloud Hotels in Seattle.

ReviewText:Overall, great walking distance from the stadium if you're going to a night game, however if you're seeing a day game better to stay somewhere else. ( only paying for location) -newline-  -newline- Bed wasn't comfortable and lacking fluffiness- too firm with very starchy sheets. They also don't provide water- you have to buy it in the gift shop.

ReviewText:If anyone wants to do a Mariners game in style, stay at this hotel. It's right across the street. Our room looked into the stadium from the top floor. The view from the pool deck is spectacular.

ReviewText:The hotel was clean and the staff were very nice. The restaurant was expensive for ordinary food. I would recommend the hotel but may want to find other local places for food. Shuttle to local attractions was wonderful.

ReviewText:We flew over for a couple of days to catch a couple of games. We took the Link from the airport to the silver cloud stadium and had to walk just a few blocks to the hotel. The location is great, you can walk down to the water front to do some sightseeing. -newline- We loved being able to just walk across the street to Safeco Field and not have to deal with traffic or parking. -newline- It would be nice if the hotel did have a small breakfast room and offer a continental breakfast considering the cost of the rooms.

ReviewText:When we found out the Silver Cloud Inn was located next to the ballpark we decided to stay the night there and not drive the hour and a half home. We were not disappointed! Not only was the location wonderful but the hotel was too. The staff was friendly, rooms were beautifully decorated and clean and the restaurant food was delicious. We will definitely be staying there again.

ReviewText:This is a hotel that takes its customer service seriously. I need to make a point of writing down some names so I could thank them personally, but every single staff member was outstanding! They are there to make your stay a great one from the second you drive up for valet parking. Great rooms, comfortable beds and perfect for a ball game or shopping downtown. Can't wait to stay again!
