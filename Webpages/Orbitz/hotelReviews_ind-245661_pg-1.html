ReviewText:Very small rooms, but very clean and well planned. Can't best the location. Valet parking $30 but most hostels in Gaslamp are $40 so good deal. We would definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:Good bed, in-room wifi. Nothing much to look at from the city view room but glimpses into other rooms at the back seemed to show garden outlooks. The toilet bowl is tiny and about 14" off the floor in the shower room, which may be an issue for those with limited mobility. Shower stall only, no tub. Microwave, fridge and safe in room. A better bathroom would make it a great stay. Near First Ave, so a fair walk along Broadway to all the eateries and bars on 5th Ave. Helpful staff and bus to Seaworld runs right outside - No. 30 then No. 9. An easy stroll down to harbour exhibits or take a bus. Buy the $5 day pass for public transport right near the stop in the Transport Office nearby and have a $5 return trip to Seaworld.

ReviewText:The Sofia was the perfect place for my short stay in San Diego. It was close to all the best restaurants and entertainment in San Diego so I didn't need to pay extra for a cab to get anywhere. It's also on the bus line that goes to Coronado Beach, which only 30 minutes via bus. The front desk clerk even provided me with a bus pass, which I used to go to the beach and got to see more of the city. Another great amenity they have there is are the free bike rentals. They don't have too many bikes, so if you're interested in seeing San Diego via bike, get there early in the morning. The restaurant also has very good breakfast. I later found out that it's one of the best restaurants in town. If I'd known earlier I would've gone for dinner. Overall, this was an awesome experience.

ReviewText:The only draw back to this property is that the rooms are very small. But they are well furnished and very clean. It's a great location at the edge of the Gaslamp District and I would recommend it.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location and the staff was wonderful. There were a few non-negotiable misc. charges of $8/night that was not posted on the website that we did not learn of until we were at the hotel which was frustrating. However, the hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and it is located in a wonderful spot between the gaslamp quarter and the bay.

ReviewText:Stayed there for a night to run the San Diego Rock and Roll Marathon. Checked in Saturday morning, the staff was friendly and quick. The room was clean and quiet. It is close from the convention center. Close to the glass lamp district . Close to Balboa park where the race starts.

ReviewText:What a wonderful atmosphere! I love the room we stayed in. The color scheme, the modern touches with the honor to the hotel's history, It was the perfect mix. I absolutely adored the weekend i spent with my boyfriend there and would absolutely recommend it to others. The room was my favorite. And the elevators are so tiny and cute! My only complaint was the valet. My boyfriend and i had to check out at 0500 and the valet was very rude. Otherwise, it's a super cute place for a cozy getaway with the love.
