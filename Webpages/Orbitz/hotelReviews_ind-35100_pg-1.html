ReviewText:Fantastic hotel. We had a great experience staying here. The location cannot get any better as it faces the Faneuil Hall and is seconds away from Gov't Center, Boston Garden, North End, Financial District and the T (subway). It's also accessible on foot to Boston Common. -newline-  -newline- It has a nice pull-in for your car, which makes you feel safe from the chaos on the roads of Boston. Once you arrive, it's easy walk to everything. The downstairs restaurant has good food, roomy, full of light, and is a wonderful place to people watch. The room was clean and the staff was very responsive. highly recommended.

ReviewText:I loved the location of this hotel, right next to Quincy Market by the Hard Rock Cafe. The room was spacious and the bathroom was amazing. I would have given this a 5 star if the front desk girls cared about us more than their weekend plans and iPhones. However, the morning staff was more than friendly at checkout, I feel like she genuinely cared about how our stay was.

ReviewText:We stayed here for two nights. The location was absolutely perfect. We could venture up or down the Freedom Trail from this central location, and being right near Quincy Market allowed us to get a quick bite at a cool landmark whenever we wanted. -newline-  -newline- The outlets in the lamp in our room didn't work so we plugged our phones in across the room instead. We did not alert hotel staff. If we had, I'm sure they would have handled it. We LOVED the walk-in shower that our room had. -newline-  -newline- They room was clean, modern, and comfortable and the staff were not overly accommodating, but efficient and competent. -newline-  -newline- We ordered dessert late one night from room service and it, and the service, was fantastic. The lady who was tending bar was pleasant and whipped me up a Ward 8, which no other bartender in town was knowledgeable enough to do so (which might say more about the other bars we frequented). -newline-  -newline- We will definitely stay here our next visit to Boston both for the price relative to other hotels in that area and because of its AMAZING location.

ReviewText:I was only here for an overnight on business. You can't beat this hotel for location. It is across the street from Faneuil Hall, next to the farmer's market, and a very short walk to either the North End or the Public Gardens. The State Street T stop is also right around the corner. My only complaint was that I had been given a handicap-accessible room, for for me the bath/shower was just ok, but since it was a short visit I didn't worry about it.

ReviewText:Traveled to Boston with my husband in July 4th weekend. We are very happy with our hotel choice. This hotel is right next to Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Walking distance to a lot of landmarks, restaurants and subway stations. It only takes 10-15 mins to the airport. The room is clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful!

ReviewText:The experience was good but wasn't Fantastic. It was pretty much the same as a little above average hotel but with a GREAT location. Parking was $50 bucks which wasn't disclosed and Wifi was an additional $10 that wasn't included either.

ReviewText:Hotel, service, food and location were first class. Decided to stay near the Quincy Market and the Waterfront after years in the Copley area. Accommodations were spacious, well designed and very comfortable. The staff was wonderful, attentive and assisted with ease when a rental car was needed to make an unanticipated day trip to Connecticut. The location is perfect. Great access to incredible restaurants, shopping, and sightseeing. Proximity to Quincy Market, the North End, Waterfront and a few authentic Irish Pubs cannot be matched. Also a reasonable stroll to catch the July 4th Fireworks along the Charles River at the Esplanade. My wife now wants to move to Boston.
