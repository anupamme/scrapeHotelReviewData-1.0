ReviewText:The rooms was nice, but the bed was horrible. There was nothing extra like breakfast or parking included so I wouldn't say it was perfect. However, the hotel was clean and the 2 staff members I encountered was friendly.

ReviewText:The location was perfect: went to a concert at Fenway, shopped along Newbury Street, had a great brunch in the South End, and ran along the Charles without needing a car. Being right next to the Pru helped navigate us home.

ReviewText:Everything was perfect. It wasn't cheap but so what? We got a great view of the Christian Scientist pool and fountain from the 28th floor. We walked through the hotel and went through the mall to our kid's apartment without having to get wet. Everybody was friendly and helpful.

ReviewText:We just spent our weekend at the Sheraton. The location is great, you can walk to almost all the turistic locations in Boston. The from was great, I payed more for an ad grade, it was in a corner with two big windows, one facing Cambridge. The bathroom was very small, and a little bit out.

ReviewText:The location of this hotel was awesome since we were going to a Red Sox game at Fenway. The concierge even provided us with written walking directions when we asked how to get there - very impressive. We were upgraded to a king suite which was very nice, but the air conditioning was on very low and it had been a hot day which meant that it never sufficiently cooled the whole space. The bedroom ended up being only slightly warm, while the extra space where the AC was located was freezing. We also struggled to figure out parking - two different receptionists and the valet were unable to give us adequate information as to where was a safe (untowable) place to leave our car over night. Overall, we were only there for about 10 hours overnight, some of which we were at the baseball game. It was a good enough room.

ReviewText:Wow! This is a marvelous hotel with everything you could possibly need. Since hotel parking was very expensive, I chose to do without a vehicle and getting around the city could not have been easier. The hotel is situated close to bus and subway transportation that will take you anywhere you might wish to go. Being so nicely located, put me in the center of great restaurants, shopping, entertainment and many historical sites. The room was smallish, but quite ample and very clean and comfortable. The bed with its nice comforter and pillows afforded a most restful sleep. The hotel made my trip to Boston perfect.
