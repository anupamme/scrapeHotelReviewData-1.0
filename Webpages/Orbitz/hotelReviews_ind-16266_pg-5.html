ReviewText:My mother and I were so pleasantly amazed at the level of customer service at The Hotel Nikko! I will definitely stay there again if I visit San Francisco - whether or not it is part of a conference. Well worth the money in every way. -newline- The staff covered all aspects of service - from holding the doors open and greeting you with a big smile and a "Welcome Back!" to absolutely flawless room service. I love being able to text the concierge - and receive a response within minutes! -newline- Phenomenal all around!

ReviewText:Spent New Year's Eve here. The room I got was smaller than I expected. Aside from that, staying here was great because of the location, security and convenience (bar and restos, Starbucks in the hotel).

ReviewText:Great Staff. Awesome Location! -newline-  -newline- Visited San Fran with my girlfriend. It was her first time here so, I thought I would get a 'fancier' hotel to make her experience more enjoyable. -newline-  -newline- We had a great time in the city and the staff were very friendly. The room we got however was not to par.. -newline-  -newline- Only complaint about the staff was that it took over 30 minutes to get our luggage #I think they forgot until I called them#. We were waiting to go out to explore the city. -newline-  -newline- The room was very small/tiny and we felt very claustrophobic. Furniture was laid out like it was a storage room. Carpet was very grimy looking and feeling. It was pretty gross to say the least. I kept my socks and shoes on the rest of the time. On the other hand.. bed was comfy, bathroom was decent. -newline-  -newline- We did not stay in the room a lot, however when we were there it was a bit noisy. Sounded like someone was moving furniture around. -newline-  -newline- I have stayed at the Hilton across the street which is also a 4 Star Hotel and it was much better experience. -newline-  -newline- I have stayed in other cities, in 3 star hotels that were much better. That's why I would say this is a 3 Star at best.

ReviewText:Thought more highly of the name. Room was ridiculously small and I think there was fungus on the grout around the bathtub.

ReviewText:I stayed 11 nights through Christmas and New Year. -newline- Everything was great. -newline- The staff was really nice from check-in to check-out. -newline- I didn't have any trouble during the travel. -newline- The location is literally a minute walk from Union Square. -newline- The room was clean and neat, smelled good. -newline-  -newline- One thing that could be improved is that if they extend breakfast roomservice time. 8:30am is kinda early for me to have breakfast when I slept late the last night :)

ReviewText:Very disappointed to find that there was an additional $20 charge to use the pool and fitness area. Otherwise it was a nice stay.

ReviewText:Very good location, but they gonna charge you for every thing, internet is very expensive, parking lot is $45 per day, breakfast is $30 per person and if you order something online they charge you to revive the package too. But I think San Francisco is a expensive city so most of the hotels is gonna be the same.
