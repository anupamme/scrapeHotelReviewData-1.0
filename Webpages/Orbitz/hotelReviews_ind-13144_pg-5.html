ReviewText:Hotel was in a great location. It was easy to get around and close to all the things we wanted to do...Fenway, shopping, dining, etc. Hotel staff was great. Room could have been cleaner. 4-star hotels shouldn't have ripped lamp shades and pieces of trash under the bed!

ReviewText:Check-in was fast and accurate. I appreciated that being a tourist from out of town. Additionally I was able to check in right away, which was excellent because I arrived much earlier than the scheduled check-in time. However, it was expensive for what it was. Fortunately I got a deal, but if I paid regular price for the experience, it would have been even more disappointing. There was also a stain on the sheet which just should have not been overlooked when making the bed, and the bathroom sink was cracked pretty bad, with peeling in the shower. Only staying for one night, it was what it was, and again, for the price of the deal, it met expectations, but full price, it would have been very disappointing.

ReviewText:This hotel was great, excellent location for the conference I attended. The staff were wonderful, very attentive and helpful. The only downside of my stay was check-in. There was a long line of people checking in and quite a wait. But even then the staff brought out free water to everyone.

ReviewText:I didn't know what to expect since I had never stayed in this area of Boston. The hotel is part of a self-contained mall/transit stop/hotel complex/even a chapel! -newline-  -newline- We took the T (subway) all over the city from this starting point. -newline-  -newline- There are wonderful restaurants, shops, and sites to see nearby.

ReviewText:Great staff experience from check in. Room was comfortable, but the temperature control was confusing. Bathroom was smaller than expected, great shower but couldn't get the drain stopper to work and couldn't take a bath.

ReviewText:Found my room on a hotel finding/price comparison website. Compared to the other hotels in the area as last minute it was... I got my money's worth for the price AND THEN SOME! Front desk staff was very friendly n it was like she already knew me having lived in the same town as me and of the number of places she worked also knew the town where my friend grew up as well. Got to the room, gorgeous. Very clean and pristine even having been in a handful of other hotel rooms before. Decent view and all around great deal for the price. Definitely would recommend.

ReviewText:I arrived at check-in time (3pm). However, the room I had reserved was not ready yet, which I discovered when I entered it with my room key and discovered the bed unmade, etc. I went back to the front desk and was given another room (with a better view) immediately. -newline- The hotel is expensive, but not much more/less expensive than other hotels so centrally located in Boston.
