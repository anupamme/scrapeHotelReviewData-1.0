ReviewText:Everything was fantastic at the Boston Loews. The staff, the design of the room, even the lattes were superb. -newline- Thanks to the excellent service, we learned a lot about Boston we would not have gotten to enjoy.

ReviewText:On a last minute work trip, most hotels in Boston were fully booked or extremely expensive. Loews was able to provide a hotel in a great location for a reasonable price considering the circumstances.

ReviewText:I was very pleased with this hotel. It was luxurious and reasonably priced, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. It was minorly disappointing that the restaurant was closed, but I understand that they are givin the building a facelift and really improving a lot with the renovations. The only other negative was how hard it was to reach, due to the confusing roads in Back Bay. I would reccomend this hotel.

ReviewText:This was our 3rd time @ the hotel & 3rd owner. We were told they were going to start a major renovation of the property shortly. The hotel was still in great shape. Service was excellent, location is good & rooms are very comfortable.. We look forward to our next stay after the renovations.

ReviewText:The hotel itself is very nice, a lot of business types to seem to frequent the hotel so if you desire a more tourist type hotel, this may not be for you. It is however in a great location, very close to a couple "T" locations which is so great! The room itself and the staff were good, very nice and helpful! It is located in the old police station which I found interesting, especially in terms of redesign.

ReviewText:This hotel was recently purchased by the Loew's Hotel chain and will be totally remodeled soon. The staff and service and room cleanliness were very fine, although the planned renovation will help make the overall experience more perfect. The bar/restaurant also had a limited menu and seating but hopefully that too will improve. Great location near parks, shopping, in the back bay. I will return.
