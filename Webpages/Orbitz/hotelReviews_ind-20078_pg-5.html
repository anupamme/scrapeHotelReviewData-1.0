ReviewText:The only issues we had was poor parking and not knowing that you could only park on one side one night and the other the next d/t street cleaning. The last night was a little noisy on the streets but that wasnt the motels fault that was d/t the rudeness of the drinkers and partiers at the bars.

ReviewText:The location was great- within walking distance to everything in the Gaslamp District but located off of a quiet little side street which was nice. This historic hotel has a beautiful exterior, lobby, and commons area. Areas of the hotel smelled old but our room smelt good. The room was small but clean & the restroom was in need of general maintenance. The older lady at the front desk is rude, but everyone else we encountered was pleasant (stayed for 3 days). Valet parking is $25 daily- but its worth it considering that parking garages cost much more!

ReviewText:We have stayed at the Horton other times and it is still a great deal in the Gas Light District area of San Diego. The rooms are clean and once you park your car you dont need it again until you leave. The staff is friendly and helpful.

ReviewText:The Horton hotel is beautiful. I love the style of hotel and really enjoyed how close it is from the city. Only think I would change is the Valet parking. It ran out when I got there so I had to park far away.

ReviewText:Cute old-timey hotel. Nice room size... Comfortable and quiet. Only complaint is parking. There was a big game so rooms were sold out and they were short on parking.i drove back to the hotel at 11pm and was told I had to find my own parking. Had to park 3 blocks away and pay $32 for the night!

ReviewText:Perfect Location for exploring the gaslamp district! The bars were all within walking distance! Went on a sunday night and was surprised how much there was to do! Staff was also very nice and genuine! Even upgraded us to a room with a balcony! My girlfriend and I loved the old building as well!
