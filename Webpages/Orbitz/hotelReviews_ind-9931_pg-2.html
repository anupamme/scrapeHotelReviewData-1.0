ReviewText:Whwen ch ekcing onto our room. We were given a conference room to sleep in with single rollaway bed in it as opposed to regular room with the king size bed we reserved. There was no TV, phone etc. The water service ans mints had been left out from the prvious meeting. The hotels answer was the had overbooked and this was all they could do. It was a pitiful situation with awful customer service. I certainly expected more from a Hilton. Will never stay here again!

ReviewText:As a family we like to take vacations to fun and relaxing locations. We don't travel very often but when we do we like to get our moneys worth. I honestly believe that for the price of the room for 2 nights and two queens for two adults and our two children we did get more than our money's worth. Our stay was quiet and had no issues with the stuff nor with anyone else staying at the hotel. We were just a few minutes away from seaworld, the zoo, and the zoo safari. Our personal favorite was the safari. The only thing that would have made it better was maybe not having to pay for parking for every night stayed but overall our stay was wonderful and weather was just beautiful.

ReviewText:Overall this is a generally great value ... the hilton sits RIGHT next to the lodge at Torrey Pines which is on an award winning golf course overlooking the cliffs and the ocean ... but for about half the price. Sweet! -newline-  -newline- Nothing special in terms of F&B or amenities but ALL that you need, including a Starbucks and pool. Staff even helped us out - we needed safety pins for our tags for the 1/2 marathon we were running. Katie at the front desk decomposed a couple of sewing kits to get us what we needed ... yay Katie thank you!! -newline-  -newline- Where they can improve: parking is awkward and pricey, timing of housekeeping not ideal and no 'make up my room' cards. Minor ... I'd stay again any day ...

ReviewText:The hotel is being renovated and we stayed in a renovated room. The room was very nice but there some incomplete items in the room. The floor molding wasn't completed in one corner. Some of the statations on the tv were fuzzy and the entertainment system needs work. The hotel is wonderful and the room overall was very nice. The small details needs to be completed before they put a guest in the room.
