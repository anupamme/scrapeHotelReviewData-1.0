ReviewText:I booked the reservation based on the value, location and nice website appearance. I ended up with so much more. The staff couldn't be any nicer. There was fresh, cold citrus and fruit infused water in the lobby at all times, as well as coffee in the morning and wine in the afternoon. The location was easy to access by car and walking distance to many desired spots. It is also a great place to run, being near Boston Common and the harbor. The fitness center was simple, yet very adequate, refrigerated towels. -newline-  -newline- The room was clean and well decorated, great bathrobes, and convenient internet access once I became a loyalty member. If other Krimpton Hotels are similar, I will look for them when I travel.

ReviewText:Overall experience good and would stay there again. Had a small issue with Air Conditioning but was resolved. WiFi should ALWAYS be included in all hotel reservations and not add-ons!

ReviewText:Perfectly situated for marathon and sightseeing. Closest hotel to the busses on race morning. The prettiest about 1.2 mile walk to Expo through the Commons and the Public Gardens, then up Boylston past the Fiinish Line. The hotel is pricey that weekend, but worth it. They put out a small buffet morning of race with foot massages after.

ReviewText:We had a great experience at the Nine Zero. The staff was fantastic. Internet access was strong and reliable. The location is perfect for visiting the historic sites, financial district or downtown- nearly everything you want to visit is in walking distance. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was also kid friendly. -newline-  -newline- Our room came with a great view of Boston Commons ( this was an upgrade, but worth it). -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:The Kimpton line is great and the Nine Zero is a favorite when in Boston. The staff at this location is great - the valets who are always welcoming, Megan Bevis and the other concierge staff who are ready and willing with great service and recommendations and Amy Fell and the front desk staff ready for any request. -newline-  -newline- Great location, nice amenities and decor, but it is the staff that will keep me coming back.

ReviewText:Great service, great location, great amenities. -newline-  -newline- Spent three nights recently on a business trip. The service, as always at Kimptons, was friendly and welcoming. Truly make you feel like they're happy to see you. -newline-  -newline- The location is perfect, just off Boston Common and an easy walk to anywhere including the North End and Quincy Market. The Freedom Trail starts just a block or so away. -newline-  -newline- Kimpton amenities are fantastic. The room was fully equipped and if you need anything, just ask. I don't often make it to the Wine Hour, but did on this trip. In addition to wine they were serving warm cider with a kick which was wonderful.
