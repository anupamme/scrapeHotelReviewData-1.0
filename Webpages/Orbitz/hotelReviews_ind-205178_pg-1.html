ReviewText:Second stay here. Spent the day at Green lake took the hotel shuttle to the Mariners game, came back and went to the "Garage" bar next door for late night drinks. The next morning I woke up and walked to Starbucks, thru the Farmers market then over to a nice park to enjoy my breakfast. It was an enjoyable weekend. There are a lot of activities near by and the hotel offers shuttle service for those that are a little farther.

ReviewText:Excellent location in Capitol Hill. Lots of restaurants, bars, concert venues, caf√©s all within walking distance. I recommend cafe presse, caffe vita, Quinn's gastropub, Elysian brewing co for food and drink, and neumo's and chop suey for concerts. There's a QFC and bartell's drugstore nearby, and a kitchenette with fridge and microwave in the room, which is very convenient if you want to snack in the room. The room is well-appointed with many practical necessities such as a hair dryer and ironing board. I also appreciated the hotel gym and complimentary shuttle service that takes you to Seattle's downtown where many of the attractions are. Overall a great value. Only suggestions would be to provide complimentary bottled waters in the room and a basic complimentary breakfast would be nice. Otherwise, this place is awesome for business travelers and tourists alike.

ReviewText:I loved staying at silver cloud broadway. The cleanliness of the room was superb. The towels were bright white, very good water pressure in the shower and excellent drainage in the tub! The last two were what's missing at most of the big hotels chains around the country (Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, etc) but Silver Cloud had everything I consider what a good hotel should have! Will stay here again if I'm back in Seattle!

ReviewText:A little out of the way but clean. A pity that they could not be bothered to get the coffee machine working. Try the crab Benedict.

ReviewText:This hotel was just average. Good for over night business trip. Wouldn't recommend for family or romantic get away. The pool was average-Kind of boring to look at. The view from the rooms are of the streets or hospital/church not of the Seattle night skyline. There is a $24 per night parking fee they didn't mention. Although the parking is underground and secured by a gate that was nice. Would have preferred to be in down town Seattle closer to shopping and restaurants, if your paying the hotel parking fee at least you can walk to destinations instead paying to park again down town!
