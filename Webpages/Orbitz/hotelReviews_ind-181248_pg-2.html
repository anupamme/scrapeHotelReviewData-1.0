ReviewText:The overall experience was good , the location of the hotel is close to Union Square , just 2 blocks away . -newline-  -newline- The building is a little bit old , its not what a JW Marriot usually offers , but the rooms were ok , specially the bathrooms , which were very clean and spacious . -newline-  -newline- The hotel doesnt offer many amenities regarding public spaces , just a medium lobby and a small restaurant where you can have breakfast . -newline-  -newline- Breakfast was ok , a little expensive , about 25 dollars per person , but there are certainly better places where you can eat. -newline-  -newline- The concierge service was great and the staff were very polite and willing to help at all times. -newline-  -newline- So to resume this review , the hotel is ok , comfortable , but i guess that for the price of it you can get a way better deal .

ReviewText:The hotel has an incredibly great location, so close to Union Square. The facilities are nice, not an extremely finest hotel but pretty acceptable. -newline-  -newline- The only problem comes with the service. Employees seem not to have advocacy to customers requests.

ReviewText:It was a good experience overall. -newline-  -newline- The hotel is close to Union Square but far enough from the crowds and busy stores. It was definitely a good sanctuary after walking around the city. -newline-  -newline- Facilities/decors are a little dated. However, management makes an effort to keep things clean and comfortable. We had booked a double standard room but with just an extra $30/night, we upgraded to a King suite. Room was spacious. Bathroom was a little old but still clean. -newline-  -newline- Service was great. The bell service was prompt and the staff was friendly. We heard strange whistling sounds when we first checked in. After a call to maintenance, they were able to locate the source (something to do with the wind) and fixed it in no time. -newline-  -newline- We couldn't detect the WiFi but Ethernet worked just fine (with a surcharge of $12.95/day). -newline-  -newline- Given the scandalously high hotel rates in SF, J.W. Marriott proved to be a good, practical and comfortable option for the price.

ReviewText:If you are staying in or around Union Sq I would definitely stay at the JW Marriott.  Excellent accomodation, friendly staff, the rooms are ideal spacious and modern, and the rate was under $300 per night.  The only down side is that room service ends at 11pm.  Overall, i recommend this hotel and will stay here the next time I am in town.  You should note that if you book marriott hotel thru [...]you will not get credit for your rewards program :(

ReviewText:Hotel rooms are hotel rooms even in nice places..are they clean yada yada yada...But service in an expensive hotel is what makes it worth the extra expence..this place delivers...When you call te desk,bellman etc they respond...our TV went out about 8-9 pm during the national league playoff..and 20 minutes later a repairman was in the room ( from home)...whomever is the manager of this place gets it

ReviewText:The hotel was clean, beautiful. Definitely more business oriented, but what I would expect from a more expensive hotel downtown. All staff extremely friendly and courteous. Would have liked a refrid.in the room though, because ice was four floors down and didn't want to take time to call rm service for ice.  No complimentary coffee near lobby which would have been nice.
