ReviewText:Great location, close to shopping and restaurants. Clean beautiful contemporary hotel with a wonderful fitness area. Pool area is clean and beautifully designed as well. Snack shop offers good options for a quick bite to eat as well as an assortment of drinks. The front desk provided me with a paper upon request everyday. Valet parking is available but I chose to park in the convenient lot across the street for half the price. We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Seattle.

ReviewText:I was at a conference--wanted a good location so that I could also go to Pike's Market (it's an easy walk from the hotel); there are convenience stores around to buy some food staples; the room itself is set up perfectly for travel, storing food (if you are a healthy person and want to buy fruits and vegetables); and the gym is great (I teach group exercise and need to stay fit on the road)--the gym really has what an exercise professional would choose (although a few ellipticals and/or spin bikes would be nice). The pool area is also beautiful and the staff is very helpful. Restaurant is appealing--not touristy but actually attractive. Overall, a great hotel.

ReviewText:My son left his blanket in our room after we left for the airport. I called and the lost and found department handled it immediately and sent the blanket to our home. Great job!

ReviewText:Our experiance at the Olive 8 was overall good. We stayed Friday - Wednesday. On Sunday when we got back to our room, there was a note from the hotel that they needed to do emergency tile work on Monday morning and the noise would probably be throughout the hotel. They started at 9:00 am which was fine, but it was VERY loud. We were so glad that we had the whole day planned away from the hotel. We completely understand that things happen and this work needed to be done. So appreciated the heads up from the staff. However, as other reveiwers have stated, the walls are pretty thin and you can hear a lot of other room/hallway noise. The staff were very pleasant & helpful. Location was great for walking to Capitol Hill and sites downtown. Would I stay there again, probably...but will try another place on our next visit to Seattle first.

ReviewText:Love this hotel, great amenities (fitness center and pool area are top-notch). Great modern rooms..,, -newline- Main hotel lobby is under construction... So that is a bummer.., I like chilling in the lobby with a coffee and newspaper, really no good atmosphere for that in this hotel during construction.

ReviewText:This is a really nice hotel. Located in the downtown, near huge shopping malls. The staffs are kind and warm-hearted. Though the house keeping is not so good, it is a nice experience live in here.

ReviewText:Rooms and pool area were fantastic. The "Urbane" restraunt near the lobby was terrible. Menu was sparse and food tasted awful. Lack of a bar area was a low point for us. Most if not all 4 & 5 star hotels have a bar area.
