ReviewText:We had a wonderful experience. The room was beautiful and very clean. The staff was excellent and very helpful. Great restaurants close by. Just a little far from local attractions. Overall great. It was nice to have the indoor pool. We went to the Yankees vs Red Sox game at Fenway. It will be a trip my son will never forget. Did the Duck boat tour which was a little long for a nine year old boy. Met lots if great people. Definitely recommend going to the sports bar across the street.

ReviewText:This is a very up market hotel within easy commuting distance to the Boston 'downtown' area (and "Cheers"!). Consider getting a "Charlie Card" for unrestricted daily commuting on all Boston public transport for $11. The hotel itself has alll the bells and whistles one would expect, including a Business Centre with internet, which makes up for the fact that WiFi in the room has to be paid for. Attentive and helpful staff, and a homely places to stay.

ReviewText:I travel about 8 times a year on business and our family travels a half dozen times a year for pleasure. The Renaissance Waterfront Hotel was a new hotel so as you would guess everything is clean, new, and contemporary. The staff and service were excellent and location was very good. The fitness center was well equipped and very clean. Several excellent restaurants in easy walking distance, cabs readily available, and this newer part of Boston is easy to access with nice views fo the water.

ReviewText:Check in was easy. The navigator was helpful in suggesting places to eat. There are multiple restaurants within walking distance, as well as a restaurant within hotel (and Starbucks!). Brunch was great--careful, it is pricey! Location is key, and the views are amazing. Room was comfortable and clean. Walls are a bit thin, but it is not an inconvenience. I would stay here again.

ReviewText:I booked the hotel for 1 night for my husband and I to celebrate an anniversary. We walked over to a restaurant and had drinks, dinner and saw a live band and it was great. The hotel pool and hot tub was nice. The locker room was very clean and the sauna was large. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We would stay here again.
