ReviewText:Great location next to Moscone Convention Center.  Room was a good size.  Clean.  Bathroom above average.  Pillows very comfortable.  Parking about $54 per day but valets were great.  Exercise gym small but good.  Great treadmills with TV monitor on machine.  Staff friendly and competent.  I would recommend this hotel if you are attending a convention at Moscone Center.

ReviewText:Our overall experience was great.  There were only a few issues we had with the stay.  The A/C was pitiful.  We had it set on 60 and it was still warm in the room.  We were visiting during a heat wave but we are from Texas and know that you don't need to keep your A/C set at 60 when it's in the 90s outside.  Also, we asked the concierge if he could print off an email for us.  He sent us to the business center which would have cost us $7 to print the email.  I understand they are there to make money ($5 for a soda from the honor bar) but he was right in front of a computer and it would have taken 2 minutes to let me sign in and print it out.  Those are really the only complaints I have.  The Bliss products were excellent.  The room was spotless when we returned.  Great location and overall great experience.

ReviewText:Great check-in experience. -newline- Best price I could find for a close to Market street and Folsom street location.  Rooms could be a little larger - then again, who needs to stay in their room while in an wonderful city! ... great value for the size. -newline- Excellent service from the bar staff.

ReviewText:I stayed at the W during my recent visit to San Francisco. I always like the W as they are always located centrally and have a modern look and feel. This one was no exception. The staff was very friendly through out the weekend. The concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and fun nightlife. The hotel was located pretty central where it was walkable to a lot of nightlife, shopping, and tourist areas. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely recommend this hotel for a younger modern crowd who enjoys going out. The hotel is always pretty high energy with loud music so probably not the best if you want a quiet hotel. -newline-  -newline- The size of the room was good and it felt clean.

ReviewText:Just got back from a great trip to SF. The W's location was PERFECT. We were traveling with our teenage daughters and they were able to go and find lots of things to do on their own within walking distance of the hotel. Lots of great restaurants nearby and right next door to the SFMOMA. I can't think of a better location. Ask for a room above the 15th floor for great views of the city. Our room on the 16th had a great view of the bay and the bay bridge. Parking at the hotel is a little steep but if  you have a hybrid they give you a $15 discount per day! The lobby area is a great place to hang out although it can get quite busy.
