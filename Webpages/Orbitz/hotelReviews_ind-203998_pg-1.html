ReviewText:Got into city at 11:00 am.Hotel took our luggage while -newline- we shopped. Got our room by 1:30, luggage delivered to room.Had a view of Denny Street on the eleventh floor. Large room, excellent bed. Pricey, but most -newline- places that had availability in downtown Seattle are -newline- quite expensive. It was quiet and no complaints. We -newline- had to catch a plane at 9:00 am the next day so stay -newline- was short.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location; we had an outstanding view of the Space Needle and within walking distance of several great restaurants (plus Starbucks and Whole Foods next to and below the hotel). It's a 2 minute drive to Pike Place/heart of downtown if have a car. The bar off the lobby entrance has a great look to it. The valet staff was outstanding. Great amenities in the room. Overall an excellent hotel and would definitely stay here again

ReviewText:Great hotel with excellent staff who immediately take care of you. More coffee?More towels? No problem. it's there in 2 minutes. Valet service is great. I needed something from Walgreens and one of the staff chased after me and said they would drive me there but I preferred to walk. Restaurant is small but we ate breakfast there every day. Food was great and they have an amazing cocktail selection. Our room even had a deep bathtub separate from the shower which I used and also a lit makeup mirror. It's a bit pricey but worth it.

ReviewText:This was my first time to Seattle and the Pan Pacific was perfect for a newbie who wanted to be close to everything. We were able to take a quick 25 minute ride on light rail from the SEA-TAC airport to Westlake Station and then hop on the free Westlake trolley that dropped us off right in front of the hotel. If you are the adventurous type, this hotel is located blocks from shopping, the Space Needle, parks and Pike's Place Market. There is also a Whole Foods located just below the hotel. The staff was divided on being very helpful and accommodating or not really being able to problem solve. The night we had dinner at the Space Needle, the concierge told us that it would be a 20-35 minute wait for the complimentary town car (which only drives you within a 2 mile radius of the hotel, so why he quoted 20-35 minutes was beyond us#. He then suggested we get a cab but didn't bother calling one for us, so we flagged one down ourselves. Other than that incident, the staff was great. The beds were a bit stiff for our tastes but unless you incorporate Sleep Number beds like the Westin, bed comfort is always a gamble when traveling. The spa was a little on the hot side (105 degrees). A comfortable temperature would have been closer to 102. Overall we enjoyed the hotel and Seattle in general. If you are able to find a deal on the Pan Pacific for less than $180/night, I would scoop it up in a heartbeat.

ReviewText:This is a fantastic hotel, with almost every major city attraction walking distance. I had looked over many hotels when planning the trip, and the Pan Pacific had the perfect decor and style. The staff is very helpful and friendly, and will recommend great places to check out. I will definitely book this hotel should I travel back to Seattle.

ReviewText:Arrived for a short stay-cation, overnight visit to Seattle. Gorgeous foyer, friendly check-in staff, and valet staff. Booked a premium king but when I arrived upgraded to a long deluxe which is larger. The room was on the 10th floor and had an amazing view of the water. Entering the room, a gorgeous bathroom with sliding doors and tub that let's you catch the view. Large walk in shower and comfortable bed. Will stay again! Valet ended up being $39 a night and the upgrade was $40.

ReviewText:One of best hotels in the US hands down! -newline-  -newline- This quite wonderful boutique hotel has just about the perfect location for exploring Seattle. -newline-  -newline- This ticks all of the boxes. Location - easy walking distance to most major attractions and shopping- There is Starbucks and Whole Foods connected to hotel, beautiful suites - with all appointments and details thought through (eg rechargers to fit old and new iplugs), superb outlook - from the huge suite windows where you can enjoy breakfast, fantastic service - a small hotel means that you don't deal with departments (front desk, concierge, housekeeping etc) but with a single "host" who can help manage every aspect of your visit to Seattle. The rooms are large and even had an nice soaking tub along with beautiful shower. And some very nice touches - like use of town car for free. I kept extending my stay and they were so accommodating and I didnâ€™t have change rooms. I wish this chain was everywhere! I will definitely be back.
