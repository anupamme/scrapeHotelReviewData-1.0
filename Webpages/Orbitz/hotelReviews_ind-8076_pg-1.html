ReviewText:My wife and I made our first ever trip to San Francisco and knew we wanted to stay in the Union Sqaure district but didn't know where. When we chose the Palomar we didn't know what to expect but as it turned out it was a wonderful choice. the location could not have been better. It was close to the square, Chinatown, AT&T Park, and all public transportation. moving about the city was fast and convenient. As for the hotel, it was very nice. Well maintained and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. We will definitely stay there on our next trip to the Bay area.

ReviewText:We visited the Palomar as part of a landmark birthday trip for my partner. When we got there, to our surprise, we were upgraded to an INCREDIBLE suite which looked out on the courtyard. There were balloons, there was prosecco - it was just fantastic. They made us feel so welcome throughout our stay and were so helpful. -newline-  -newline- Yes, the restaurant was closed for renovations, but...it's San Francisco! If you can't find someplace amazing to eat nearby, you need to review your life choices. And if you were too lazy to leave the hotel, well, the staff were ready, willing and able to pick up food at 15 different local restaurants and bring it right to your door. Now THAT'S service!

ReviewText:The location could not be more convenient, and the room and lobby were clean and very pleasant. Staff were great. We didn't spend a lot of time there or take advantage of the happy hour or dining options, but we were happy we chose it.

ReviewText:Hotel is great, but room 504 is right outside the restautant longe, and is noisy, even at night. I was awoken at about 11 by some loud talking and laughter, because it was literally 12 feet from my door.

ReviewText:As a conference host and traveling often - there is nothing like getting into a hotel that does it right! Beautiful, clean hotel with exceptional customer service. In the midst of a very hectic week, coming into the sanctuary of that hotel made a world of difference in able to rest for full days of work.

ReviewText:I really do love all of the Kimpton hotels. From the moment you walk in the door everyone is friendly, helpful, and just a joy. -newline-  -newline- Only bummer was not having coffee in your room, and then having the coffee in the center taken away at 10AM, but it is a small price to pay for everything else being perfect. And, the coffee that was available was outstanding (much much better than "hotel room" coffee).

ReviewText:This is a small European style property that is very close to Union Square. The staff were unbelivablly nice and attentive, opening the door for us on our return from excursions and calling us by name! Very personalized service. From someone who teaches human resource development and customer service at a major university, I was quite pleased with what I experienced. We would definitely stay at this property the next time we are in San Francisco!
