ReviewText:While the facility is excellent and the location is very convenient, it is the people who make the Alexis head and shoulders above the competition. They are all friendly and professional and they all clearly enjoy their job.

ReviewText:We stayed for a week at the Alexis and had a great experience. The hotel is centrally located and just about everything is no more than a 15 minute walk. The room was unique and beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the service was great.

ReviewText:Love Kimpton properties typically. Unfortunately this one doesn't have the restaurant & bar scene most of their other properties do. Ridiculously expensive breakfast that was poorly prepared! BUT as a hotel only, great, clean location in Seattle even if the rooms are a little stuffy and difficult to regulate temperature!
