ReviewText:The location of the Sheraton is amazing. right in the heart of Back Bay. It is centrally located and next to all the food and shopping you need. That was pretty much the only amazing thing about it. -newline-  -newline- The room was clean and it had new furniture but the bathroom was old and dingy. My wife found a dirty towel and when I called to ask for more, they never came. Service was average and the hotel was really crowded. I would stay here in the future only if I had a really good deal, otherwise i will book and another hotel in the area, even if it costs and extra $30-$40 a night.

ReviewText:We were in Boston to look at colleges. The Sheraton is located right next to a subway station that will take you all over the city. It is also connected to a mall that has everything you could possibly need, and so many restaurants. I definitely plan on staying here every time I am in Boston!

ReviewText:Great hotel. The rooms are very large and comfortable. Would like to see a larger bathroom, but they were very clean and nice. Nice to have shopping connected to the hotel and so many restaurants near by.

ReviewText:The hotel is easy to reach just off of I90. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is friendly. The cost for parking, I found, unreasonably high.

ReviewText:Made a last minute reservation, and was able to check in early and the very welcoming and friendly staff upgraded my room... Breakfast in the morning was a nice buffet. After a night out in Boston the 1 o'clock check out was ideal. Parking was easy - a self park was attached to the hotel. I will be back at this hotel! It's a quick walk to Fenway park.

ReviewText:Rooms were very nice ,clean and comfy. Walking distance to sights but a long walk to some sights. Close to train take the train to the north end eat and walk it off seeing the sights on the way back! We walked alot at first then later found we could take the train to any place and mostly walked back.! Go to the second floor of the hotel walk into Prudental Plaza lots of shoppping great food court and a short cut to many places!
