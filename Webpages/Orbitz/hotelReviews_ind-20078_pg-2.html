ReviewText:The Horton Grand was absolutely charming! It's not your modern hotel setup, but is very clean and all of the antique decor is beautiful. I would highly recommend the Palace Bar located in the lobby! Fabulous drinks made with lots of love and even live music on Fri and Sat nights!

ReviewText:My husband and I were in town for a wedding and enjoyed our stay at the Horton grand hotel. The location was centrally located and a quick walk to Petco field. The rooms were very clean and the staff was friendly. Great pic for the price.

ReviewText:Quarter mile from the convention center just off the busy streets in the gaslamp quarter. Lots of restaurants close by. Morning runs along the harbor were nice, so a gym at the hotel was not needed. Room was on the smaller side, just enough room for 2 queen beds and a desk, but it wasn't uncomfortably crammed. Fireplace in the room, while not needed, gave it some character.

ReviewText:This hotel has a great price and perfect location! Located right next to San Diego's hottest nightclub, and all the popular restaurants/bars. Everything was walking distance from this hotel. Cool little history behind this hotel too, built in the 1800's! Definitely coming back here.

ReviewText:This hotel is in the perfect place if you wish to stay in the Gaslamp District. I could walk to the convention center in only five minutes (and a very safe walk). You are only 10 minutes walk from the the ballpark and 15 minutes from the USS Midway. The rooms were clean with all the expected amenities. I try and stay here when I come to San Diego.

ReviewText:Good value. Historic hotel in the heart of the gas lamp quarter, with exceptionally helpful staff. If you want a min-bar and a gym, go elsewhere. This is a relaxed, clean, place with a vey good hotel bar, central courtyard and some nice antiques.

ReviewText:We've previously stayed at the Horton Grand Hotel - can't fault it at all. Location is excellent if you want to be in the thick of it in the Gaslamp Quarter or a stroll from the waterfront. Always found the staff to be friendly and helpful and this time was no different. We'll definitely be coming back.
