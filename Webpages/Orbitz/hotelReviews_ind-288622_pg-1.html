ReviewText:Courteous staff, especially Marcia. Took the time to explain to me best way to get around the area and she saved me a $30 cab ride. Great breakfast bar. Less than impressed with fitness room. Overall a nice place conveniently located.

ReviewText:An inadequate window air conditioner never kept the room dry and comfortable. Staff was unhelpful. Room was smaller than a breadbox. Not so good.

ReviewText:Nice facility, great staff. The parking is tight and our room was slightly smaller than we had expected, but the hospitality of the staff made our stay great. From the staff at the front desk, the housekeeping crew, and the breakfast room staff, everyone went out of their way to be sure that we had everything just the way we wanted it. Great location for trips into San Diego. What a nice experience! We would certainly recommend this place to others.
