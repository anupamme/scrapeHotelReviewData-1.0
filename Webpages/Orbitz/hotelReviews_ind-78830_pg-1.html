ReviewText:Beautiful hotel in a great location. Rooms are nice and clean, only complain is a falsely displayed price. Online price said 250 and we ended up having to pay 400

ReviewText:Vitale was recommended by several friends as the spot in SF. The scene, location & restaurant didn't disappoint, as it was a good mix of business & social crowd, with no disruption to hotel. The views were incredible, though my room was bright too early as I faced the bay, and room design is due for a refresh . The gym is sub par, but you're on the waterfront for great running/walking. The roof deck was a nice touch, though underutilized. Overall great experience

ReviewText:Great location, dining was excellent and bar had good staff (and outstanding outdoor patio). Overall, service level was inline with 4-star quality and staff was very friendly. My room had a nice bay view, but the room design felt a little tired & needed a fresher feel. (Only knock was the room design). It's a nice boutique & even though some reviews rate it 5-star (which it's not), it's a solid 4-star experience.

ReviewText:Overall solid experience and good value for price. Great bar & restaurant, prime location and nice staff. The rooms are decent, but design is tired & needs a refresh. Given its proximity to great outdoor areas, the gym is below average. Overall experience was good/4-star boutique quality.

ReviewText:I stayed one night only at this lovely hotel, that I enjoyed the last time I was in SF. In short, everything was good until checking out...I was notified that my car would take 30 minutes to return, and this was after paying the hotel 50 dollars.
