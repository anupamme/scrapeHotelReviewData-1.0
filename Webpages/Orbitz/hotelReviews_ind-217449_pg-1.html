ReviewText:staff was courteous and helpful. Room was adequate and clean. Bathroom a little small. Location was ok but slightly removed from main activity locations. Considering the time of year, pricing was pretty good. -newline- Parking structure is suicidal!! Yikes. Better than Mr. Toad's ride. But, I had a great weekend in San Diego.

ReviewText:It was exactly what I needed on this business trip, a room to sleep and complimentary breakfast. That being said it was a walk to many food and drink establishments but the price was the selling point.

ReviewText:the room was clean, but the color of the walls and the carpet made the room seemed old. restroom was small, so for a couple girls that were trying to get ready, it made things a bit difficult. The one thing that I did not appreciate was that they charged parking, i was not told there would be a change when they first handed me the permit, all the front desk said was "here is your parking permit for our parking garage" and how to get there. at the end of the trip i was told there was a $32 dollar charge on my card for parking. First off, that sucks that you have to pay for parking when you already paid for the room, second, what would have happened we never used the garage? (it was a bit inconvenient) would they still have charged me? other than that the staff was friendly and the room was comfortable.

ReviewText:The hotel was very accomodating. We ended up getting an extra room so they comped us parking for 1 car. The breakfast was delicious and the lemonade in the lobby was refreshing. I didn't realize until the second day, but there are also delicious cookies in the lobby as well. The location was great. We were able to walk to gas lamp district and get there faster than taking a taxi (about $10).

ReviewText:The location is within walking distance of many great shops restaurantas. The room was clean, but could have been better. Some of the staff was nice others were a little rude. Overall not a bad stay, but I ahve had better at other Holiday Inn Express.

ReviewText:The lobby area is nice, but my room looked a bit worn out. Carpet had water stains, d√©cor was really dated. Shower could use renovation. I stay at Holiday Inns up and down the coast for business, this is OK, but I have stayed in much nicer H. I. that have been renovated. Not worth the cost compared to other hotels in the area, especially the $16 a night parking fee......

ReviewText:Hotel is nice but unless you need to be Downtown you would do better at the Old Town Holiday Inn Express. Parking your car here costs $16 per day! There is no charge to park at Old Town and they also have free shuttles that can take to many of the areas attractions.

ReviewText:We decided to spend a week in San Diego because we had never been there and there would be a lot to do. We were not disappointed. What I enjoyed about our stay was that this hotel provided shuttle service. Because I have a difficult time seeing, the shuttle service was a great asset. The rooms were nice and the staff was great. I highly recommend this hotel.
