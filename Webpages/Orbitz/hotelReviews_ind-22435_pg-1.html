ReviewText:They don't have a pool... but everything else was lovely. We had a wonderful, clean room. It was nicely decorated and very comfortable. -newline- They had wifi, complementary for those who were part of their Hilton reward programs. -newline- We got a complimentary breakfast and hordervers with our room. Very tasty, and a good variety. And we had a nice view of the Space Needle. -newline- By the way, WONDERFUL LOCATION! My husband and I are moderately active. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Space Needle, Aquarium, Pioneer Square. Would stay here again.

ReviewText:Great location to go to the pier within 15 mins walk. It makes me have enough time to have a good dinner and take a cruise there. And close to the light rail station within 5 mins walk. No need to get a taxi to airport at all. But it's a pitty that there is no shades covering all window. The shade on two sides is for decoration only but not able to cover the window. The sun light can easily go into the room in the morning and might wake you up though...

ReviewText:We had a one night stay to attend a concert in Benaroya Hall. It's an easy 3 block walk to Benaroya Hall from the hotel. Pike's market is another block walk from Benaroya Hall. Fantastic location for dinning and shopping.

ReviewText:Hotel was nice and conveniently located in downtown Seattle. Only comment would be the room size which was very small. That said it was adequate and fulfilled the needs of 2 people. Would stay here again.

ReviewText:The Hilton has an excellent location just a short walk form the University Metro Station where you can get mass transit to many locations throughout the city. It is also walking distance from the light rail system from the airport (2nd to the last stop on the rail line) at University. High security is an added benefit in that room keys are required to take elevators to one's room. There are some excellent room views as well of the harbor and city. Finally, the staff are very friendly and very helpful. I rate this hotel very highly.

ReviewText:Located at 6th Avenue and University, the hotel offers elegantly appointed guest rooms with work desk, mini fridge, large screen TV with about 30 free channels, full length bathroom mirror, in room safe, adjustable thermostat/fan and ample illumination. Front desk staff was welcoming and courteous. You'll have to do some serious uphill climbing to reach this property. -newline-  -newline- My only complaint is the $10.95/day PER DEVICE WiFi charge, which is a ripoff. If you're a Gold member of the honors program, or if you subscribe to certain internet providers, you'll get WiFi free of charge. I hope the WiFi charges will be dropped as is the trend these days.

ReviewText:We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Seattle. Upon arrival, the front staff was friendly and helpful. Good first impression! Good location in the heart of downtown Seattle and most attractions are easily walkable. Room was clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay again next time.
