ReviewText:The JW Marriott was the perfect location for shopping, dining, Chinatown and all local transportation.  Check-in was very quick and easy. The glass elevators that run up the center of the property were very fast.  The concierge was very helpful. The rooms were fairly large for San Francisco and very well appointed.  There was a scale in the bathroom which was a first for us.  A nice large plasma TV was in the room and the bed was very comfortable. The maid service usually came before noon and keep the room very clean. We had a deluxe room and were on the 15th floor with a fairly nice view.  I will stay at this property again when I return to San Francisco.

ReviewText:The JW Marriott on Post was a great choice.  For the last 18 years our foursome has gone shopping for  long weekends. This was our first stay at the JW but we will go back.  The hotel has been redecorated since it was the Pan Pacific.  It's warm,  modern and the rooms are generous.  Our beds were comfortable and we heard very little street noise.  The bath was luxurious and had seperate tub and shower.

ReviewText:Most of the staff very helpful and try to please.  Concierge exceptional. He gave us excellent recommendations for dining and other things.  Housekeeping very accomodating. They brought what we asked for quickly and with a smile. Robes supplied. Large closet. Walk to everyplace, safe and pretty area, 1 block from Union Square. Close but away from the commotion. Nice lobby. Hotel, clean, pleasant, nice place to return to after long day. Comfortable size room. Long vanity w/plenty of room for 2 females to put their nonsense out. Only 2 negatives: 1)w/2 people in a room there is a shortage of drawers. Take out the builtin magazine rack and put in 2 more drawers. 2) Shower floor slippery. Good value. Recommend highly for couples, girlfriends, etc.
