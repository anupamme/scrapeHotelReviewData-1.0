ReviewText:JUST NOT UP TO THE STANDARD EXPECTED FOR TOP DOLLAR HOTELS. Leaky taps in the bathroom, the sink plunger did not work, the TV was antiquated and not tuned in, despite requests to be fixed. Very noisy ice machine, like having the builders in! No concierge lounge, front desk manager not very hospitable or sympathetic to my complaints. We also had a theft from the room, resolved by a refund of one nights stay.

ReviewText:This hotel was in a good location. It was close to the long wharf and the outdoor market. The hotel itself was just so-so, nothing special. When we first arrived we did not have a refrigerator or the bath robes that were on the site listings. We told the front desk and they were promptly sent up to our room. Our room was very small and cramped. There was no circulation fan in the bathroom so when you took a shower everything was steamed up. When talking to other travelers who were at other hotels, they paid the same price as us and got way more for their money. On a good note,the staff was very friendly.

ReviewText:We visited on one of the hottest and most humid days of the year. Unfortunately their air conditioning was not up to dealing with this. Despite having the thermostat set to it's lowest I couldn't get more than a weak pant out of the AC vent. At breakfast they had a staff change in the middle which resulted in the omelet we ordered taking over 30 minutes to turn up. I had finished my breakfast by the time my girlfriends turned up. The ice machine on my floor was broken. Having raised these issues directly with Hilton they offered a free breakfast if we stay there again, thanks.
