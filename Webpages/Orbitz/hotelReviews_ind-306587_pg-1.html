ReviewText:The staff and customer service were outstanding from the moment we pulled up in our car, they were there to assist us in every way! We got to our room and my husband wanted a better view and they immediately accommodated us! We went from the 5 floor to the 8 th and as we got off the elevator on the 8 th floor a staff member was waiting for us with the new keys! No one could have done anything more to make our stay more perfect! We will definitely be back!

ReviewText:Me and my wife decided to stay in the Hotel Indigo for the second time now because of its easy location to the Gaslamp and Petco Park area. It is just off the path enough to get out of each main area but its also close enough that you are right there. Great views as well.

ReviewText:The hotel was nice. The "view" from my view room was less than desirable. The location was decent, but I should have checked the baseball schedule before booking as parking in the evening was a challenge - unless you wanna pay $41/night at the hotel.

ReviewText:Never been to this hotel before and was a bit skeptical because it was not big name chain. Boy was I wrong. At first glance I was not sure, not fancy from the outside. When I arrived I was greated by hotel vallet who assisted me inside. This is my only negative about this hotel. Vallet is the only way to park and it cost 40 dollars. I thought that was a bit steep. -newline-  -newline- Once I entered hotel I was amazed at the modern decor, the fancy bar and how close it was to gas lamp and stadium. From this hotel you can walk to all the attractions and can walk to trolly and venture out to old town . This hotel has free wi-Fi and a awesome bar in the ninth floor that overlooks the baseball stadium. -newline-  -newline- Room - our room was amazing for the price. Super modern, clean, comfortable beds, safe, krugs coffee maker, and shower for two cause you gotta conserve water! Dogs are more then welcome at this hotel. They even have a grass area for the little guys. For the price I was truely impressed! I would recommend this place to friends and family.

ReviewText:Indigo is a wonderfully swanky yet unassuming little boutique hotel at the edge of the Gaslamp District of San Diego. The front desk staff are impeccably professional, helpful, and actually quite nice! Wi-fi is included, there's a fitness center, business center, and restaurant/bar. It's even a LEED-certified building! The room and bathroom are contemporary in appearance, but it's very comfortable. The large glass-enclosed shower (without tub) is quite luxurious. They even provide a Keurig machine with various cups so you can make a morning pick-me-up before you leave the room! -newline-  -newline- Several great little restaurants are easily within walking distance, like the Broken Yolk, and The Mission. Up on the roof there's a gorgeous deck/bar area, with gas firepits and an incredible view into the Padres stadium! I would definitely stay here again, no questions asked. The convention center is about a 10 minute brisk walk. The hustle and bustle of 5th street is just 4 blocks away, and Market Street is just one block away. Great location!

ReviewText:Beautiful room, great location, good value. No pay per view movies or pool, but minor stuff, really. Good food and drinks in the restaurant and bar. An overall great experience.

ReviewText:Some of the best staff ever! Very comfortable bed and pillows. Great location within walking distance of restaurants, shopping, etc. Short drive to Balboa Park and other locations. The only reason I rated the amenities as less than perfect is that it would be nice to have a little fridge in the room. They also accept dogs, for those who need it. Highly recommend!
