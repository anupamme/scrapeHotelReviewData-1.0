ReviewText:We stayed here for 2 nights and it was perfect. The staff was very professional and helpful. The room is spacious and the bathroom very nice. Appreciated the complimentary tea and Starbuck's coffee served in the lobby every morning. Only one disappointment: we came here for another night and got a room right next to the ice machine which was very noisy at night. We called the reception to inform them about the noise and they offered to move us to another room. Since it was late and we already unpacked our bags, we didn't want to move and fortunately the noise stopped. Don't know if they turned it off or if the noise was only temporary. So just make sure you don't get a room next to the ice machine and you'll have a great stay!

ReviewText:The location and look of the hotel was really nice. The rooms looked exactly as pictured! The walls were a bit thin. My boyfriend and I woke up to the other rooms laughter several times. Then could here there whole conversation the next morning. That wasn't too bad though! We liked the room and love that they are pet friendly! We will definitely come back!

ReviewText:This hotel was in the perfect location for walks along the waterway, Pike Street Market and the retail shopping. The staff was incredibly helpful all of the way around and they even did a hosted wine hour at 5pm every day. Would definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:My sister and I especially enjoyed the complimentary cocktail-hour wine in the lovely central lobby. The rooms were cheerfully decorated and comfortable, and the staff always helpful. One of the best features of this hotel is location, within walking distance of many downtown highlight and the light rail. Highly recommended -- and a hotel I'd choose again.
