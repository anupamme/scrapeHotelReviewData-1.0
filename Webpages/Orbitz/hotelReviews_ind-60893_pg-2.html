ReviewText:This was an easy in, easy out stay. The hotel is close to food, bars, airport, gas station and car rental facilities. -newline- The staff was friendly and the room was clean and was quiet considering there were 5 different soccer teams there and the hotel was sold out.

ReviewText:I really liked staying here. It was clean and comfortable. Good selection of channels on the tele. The worst part is that the bed was SOOOO comfortable I was late for work twice because I didn't want to get up. Nice firmly soft pillows. Not puffy -newline-  -newline- The only improvement needed is room service. There is no room service. But the restaurant is right there. -newline-  -newline- The food there is pretty good.

ReviewText:Great experience. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was helpful and courteous. And the fact that there is free wifi was the best amenity in my opinion.

ReviewText:Convenient to airport. Rooms clean and well appointed. Nice large bay window. Also close to transit train to get downtown if you wanted to. Staff friendly and efficient. I was with a small dog, and they gave me a pet room. They have quite an extensive pet policy, including "don't leave pet in room unattended, even in a kennel" - so it isn't a place you can really come and go. But if you're just stopping overnight before or after a flight, or passing through, then I recommend staying here. Additional fees: parking $10 and pet $15 - just so you know...

ReviewText:We had the hotel pick us up at the airport the night before (we turned in the rental car). Then they brought us to the airport early in the morning. Worked out great. The bar/cafe in the hotel was very good also!
