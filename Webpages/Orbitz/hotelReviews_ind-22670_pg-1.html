ReviewText:I was in San Francisco in March for a conference and stayed in the Union Square area. For our anniversary trip in July, i wanted to stay in an area with an ocean view and within easy walking access to attractions and restaurants. The Hyatt Regency San Francisco was in a great location, and our room had a great ocean view. I wish I had better luck with public transportation, because the buses and BART would have been a lot cheaper than taking taxis. The trolleys are a novelty but their routes can be a little limited, and they are not always convenient to catch. Walking around the Embarcadero area is flat and easy. There are many great restaurants, from casual to more upscale, near the hotel. There is also a Farmer's Market with local artisans selling their wares nearby 3+ days a week. The Ferry Building is across the street ... more restaurants and specialty shops. Our room was always clean and comfortable. The Housekeeping staff was superb ... very friendly and accommodating. At this time, there is construction around the Hyatt Regency, which can be "rough" on the taxi drivers, as well as, to your wallet. It is advisable to have the taxi drop you off near the hotel and walk the rest of the way. It is not advisable to keep the window in the room open, because of the construction and street noise, as well as, the possibility of pigeons flying into the room. There are street people around, but my husband and I never felt unsafe. I only had breakfast once in the hotel. The maitre d' came across as unfriendly and definitely lacked people skills. The waiter was slightly better. For the rest of my stay, I took my breakfast business to the Starbucks across the street. The hotel bell service staff was friendly. The valet staff was friendly and very helpful with any direction questions. The front desk clerk at check-in was a little aloof but professional. She appeared knowledgeable. The front desk clerk at check-out was very friendly and accommodating. There was an error with my bill, and she quickly made the correction. I would consider staying at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco again and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.

ReviewText:All about location and views from Regency Club which is worth the upgrade as good breakfast and evening drinks.Note drinks are on Honesty Box basis so not free as one might expect in Club Rooms and not sure how many Quests are really honest. -newline- We had initial room 1730 but had to move due to excessive noise from Bathroom vents which could not be turned off be warned. -newline- All staff were good and friendly and room was eventually fine.

ReviewText:Breakfast in restaurant sub par, not enough available at 9am, what was there was already cold. -newline- Concierge at hotel had no pull to get me into any good restaurants 24hrs in advance. Front desk could not loan me a pair of sissors, I had to go down to front desk. -newline- Cost to park car at hotel was double what other lots in area were charging, and retrieving car took 1/2 hour.

ReviewText:I know this area well, and it could and would be so much better if there were no major construction work outside the hotel. it was very loud throughout the day even during the night. Otherwise, room is clean and spacious. no bottled water. just try the tab.
