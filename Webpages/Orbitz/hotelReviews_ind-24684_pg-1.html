ReviewText:A hotel with history. Great location. However, prices for in-room food and bar, very expensive. Staff very informative and helpful. Overall, I would return in a heartbeat. Comfortable, airconditioned room.

ReviewText:This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. Our room this year had a queen bed and was very tiny for our 10 day stay but we made it work. Dominic, who checked us in when we arrived, was amazing. Every staff member we encountered was friendly. The workout room is functional. It is more economical to eat and drink outside of the Omni. The location can't be beat! We did the Freedom Tra Run which started at Boston Common. We went to two Red Sox games, walking both times. We went on a walking chocolate tour starting from Copley square. We also walked to the North End and Quincy Market.

ReviewText:Decent value. Good location. But a little run down.And its huge size (over 500 rooms) meant impersonal service and very crowded and noisy public spaces. The experience was OK, but a little depressing.

ReviewText:Stayed in a junior king suite. The room was decent sized although the bathroom was teeny tiny. The bed was fantastic and the room was overall very clean and very quiet. The view left a lot to be desired and had to keep the blinds (no sheers option) shut due to office staff about 12 feet away. That was a bummer, as was my broken TV. Overall though, it was cute in a charming, historical way, which I like. Fans of modern hotels should look elsewhere.

ReviewText:Excellent hotel ideal location to explore the city, short walk to Boston Common etc. Friendly and helpful staff helped organise my travel to Nantucket Island. In the future it would be helpful to enjoy my stay more if there was a fridge in the bedroom and also if there had been an office/ computer facility within the hotel. Overall a good location, for added value it would be good if breakfast was included as part of the room price.

ReviewText:The staff were pleasant. The hotel has a wonderful location and my room was quiet and clean. The air conditioning was super. The telephone did not function on my last night and I had to request a staff member to knock on my door for a wake up call - but that worked.
