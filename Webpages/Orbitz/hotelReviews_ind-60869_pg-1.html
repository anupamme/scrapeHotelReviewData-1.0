ReviewText:This was a great hotel. We were very impressed by the decor and cleanliness. We LOVED the huge shower heads and noticed they definitely had a water softener or something. The restaurant on the 5th floor looked really nice too, although we didn't eat there. The location is perfect for visitors who could easily walk to great restaurants, Pike Place Market, with close walking distances to the light rail station back to SeaTac and the monorail to the Space Needle. -newline-  -newline- The only con was that when I originally made my reservation we reserved for the "Red Lion Hotel". We walked around everyyywhere around the block of 5th ave. and could NOT find our hotel until I used Google maps to tell me it was a building directly in front of us the whole time but with the name change "Motif" Hotel. They said they changed the name literally a month ago, but we wished we were at least notified of the change to save us all the trouble with our luggage walking around downtown.

ReviewText:I would avoid rooms near the elevator if you are sensitive to noise. The noise for the elevator traveling by comes in through the ventilation ducting.

ReviewText:Place was in a perfect location and the staff was helpful and always on top of it!!! My only negative comment was the elevator was so loud - I could feel it and hear it go up and down at night. The other thing was the dresser was not leveled so the drawers opened up all the time- even on its own. Water view was awesome - make sure that if you are on lower floors that you are not over frolic- very loud and could hear the music from the 19th floor.

ReviewText:This hotel has a great location & is contemporary & very comfortable. The beds were superb & we had a room with pretty views of the water & Pike Street Market. Front of house was very friendly, accommodating, helpful & efficient - both at the desk, bell-boys & concierge (who was only present on Saturday). Frolic seems popular with locals but we walked in at 1100 one day & no one noticed us, wait staff seemed unhappy & rushed so we did not return. Overall very happy with our stay & would make first choice for return visit in Seattle.
