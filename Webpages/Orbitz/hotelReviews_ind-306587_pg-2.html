ReviewText:This Hotel was conveniently located in the Gaslamp in downtown San Diego. Walking distance to all the many restaurant and bars. It was very stylist / clean and comfortable. We loved it.

ReviewText:Based on advertising, we expected this hotel to be right in the Gaslamp district. It is on the edge, and around the corner from a rather dirty area.

ReviewText:This was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. Every last detail was taken care of. The room layout is excellent and spacious. The whole feel of the hotel is welcoming and the staff are especially friendly and kind. I will be back and liked it a lot more than the typical hotel chain.

ReviewText:Stayed one night and had a great time. I took advantage of the gym and the outdoor bar on the 9th level overlooking the ballpark. The only negative was the $39/night parking.

ReviewText:I was really pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The staff were all really friendly, the rooms were perfectly clean, very spacious and beautifully decorated. The location was right in the middle of all the bars and restaurants of the gas lamp district and only a 10minute drive from Coronado Island and Mission Bay. The best surprise was the funky rooftop bar that overlooked the baseball stadium, a great place to start your evening.

ReviewText:Overall a great experience. A few things that the customer should know us that if your dog is barking at night while you are out and about in town, the hotel will call you to let you know that you need to comback to quiet your dog. The breakfast prices are ridiculously overpriced and if you don't want to walk 3 block with you luggage be prepared to pay $50 for valet parking per day.

ReviewText:This hotel was really cute, nice decor. I had a gorgeous view of the skyline. The area is great to enjoy boutiques and tons of great restaurants. It is very easy to get around from this location. The parking at the hotel is a little too much !
