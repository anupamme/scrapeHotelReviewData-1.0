ReviewText:We just returned from Pacific Terrace and had a great stay. It's the perfect location right on the boardwalk and within walkin distance of several restaurants. The staff was very helpful and nice as well.

ReviewText:We booked the Pacific Terrace at the last minute in order to stay in San Diego for one more day, and wished we had stayed there the entire time! Very nice room and so close to the beach!

ReviewText:we stumbled upon this place while searching for a hotel online.. The moment I saw it,I fell in love with the property. We've been to San diego multiple times before and we have never stayed in Pacific Beach so we were amazed that this hotel has the perfect location.

ReviewText:Staff is exceptional - really going out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Location is also outstanding right on Pacific Beach. You can walk out of the pool gate right onto the paved boardwalk - really doesn't get better. -newline- Rooms are a bit dark, with low ceilings and there are few ceiling lights. Was upgraded to the presidential suite - essentially a very large room with a couch, and a jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom - slightly underwhelming given the grandiose name, but still very nice. -newline- Many rooms have kitchens kitchenettes - which are nice. Good ocean view from the rooms that have them - they tend to be right above the pool.

ReviewText:Hotel was very nice and was in a perfect location close to all attractions in the San Diego area. The air conditioning in our room did not work well, but we were not in our room much and at night we left the screen door open since it was cool we could listen to the waves. -newline-  -newline- Parking was $25 per day, but you can park on the street for free if you can find a spot. Also there is a $14 per day resort fee that we were not aware of. So take advantage of using the facilities - complimentary use of bikes, chairs & umbrellas for the beach, family picture, wine upon arrival, cookies in afternoon...etc -newline-  -newline- The views from the room were fantastic! Reminded me of Maui. Definitely worth the extra money to get the full ocean view room and on be on floors 2 or 3. -newline-  -newline- Overall a great property and lots of fun. Great memories! :)
