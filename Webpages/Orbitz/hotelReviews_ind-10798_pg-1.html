ReviewText:The hotel is just too noisy with street noise from the events in or out of the hotel that were loud and noisy.

ReviewText:The room was fine, nothing to brag about, but not bad. The staff was friendly. We asked the Bellman to call a cab for us. He called an unmarked limo without a meter who didn't know the City, made us get out 5 blocks from our destination and charged us more than double what a real cab did door to door on our return trip. I have to believe the Bellman was getting a kickback. Management did not respond to my complaint. I can't recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:The room was adequate but old. The location was not very accessible to attractions in the area without taking some sort of transportation. The staff was disinterested.

ReviewText:This Hotel is nice but not as nice as it could be. Its getting close for renovation because of the outdated fabrics and bathrooms. A bit over priced but the location for San Francisco adventure was really good. -newline- I will say that the Staff was very friendly and made my time there very pleasant. I would stay there again..

ReviewText:The hotel was clean, staff friendly, overall it was a good experience and the location was perfect for seeing all the sites at the wharf. Only complaint, I booked in the main hotel and was given a room at the annex so had to walk over, which was not a bad thing but not what was requested. Last night asked for a 3:00 am wake up call which never came. Overall it was a nice hotel. I would stay again. Thanks

ReviewText:This hotel is located very close to a few attractions, you can walk or access to transportation. Amenities are just okay, some areas look like they need a renovation soon. Staff is friendly but they try really hard to sell you the tours, food service, etc hotel offers.
