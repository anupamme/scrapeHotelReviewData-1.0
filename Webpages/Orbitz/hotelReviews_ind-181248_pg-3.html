ReviewText:I traveled with my 2 adult daughters who ran the Nike Women Marathron on October 18th 2009. -newline- Ice, soda and snack machines on the floors would have been nice. -newline- This was much better than the "W" in New York.

ReviewText:This 20 floor hotel is close to union square.  We paid extra for the city view room which was on the 19th floor.  Stayed Monday August 10th left the morning of Thursday August 13th.  In summary: -newline- Good: -newline- •	Great city view (paid extra for this) -newline- •	Close to Union Square -newline- Bad: -newline- •	Only 2 of the 4 elevators were working (again on the 19th floor of a 20 floor hotel) many customers complained about this as the elevators were VERY slow.  We didn't see anyone working on them during our stay. -newline- •	A/C was way too noisy and had a hard time keeping the room cool. -newline- •	Called to see where the ice dispenser was located at and was advised the "Butler" would be glad to bring some up…..THE BUTLER NEVER SHOWED. -newline- •	Day prior to leaving complained to the manager about service and advised of things which hadn't work in the room (bath fan and light) and had shuttle set up for return to airport pick up at 8:30 the next morning….Next morning found out pick up was never set up and had to scramble to get a pickup with the new manager.  No documentation of the things that needed to be fixed. -newline- •	Pictures on line are better than the actual room. -newline-  -newline- When we booked a month in advance of our trip the rating was 4.8 out of 5.0. 1-2 weeks prior to leaving the rating was at 4.4 out of 5.0.  Would NEVER recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:The location was good ,very close to Union Square. -newline- The parking area was under construction.The bell -newline- captain/valet service was good. The management staff -newline- seemed helpful, but really were not. We had a Marriott rewards package that included breakfast for -newline- two and 4 movie tickets. Initially,they were not  honoring this Orbitz/Marriott reward. I called Orbitz -newline- customer service twice to intervene. What would have -newline- been a nice hotel stay ended up a stressful one. -newline- The room was nice with good city view, the bathroom -newline- was fine except a problem with bath tub drain not -newline- working. Next, I will be staying at another hotel. -newline- I highly recommend Orbitz customer service.

ReviewText:We thought the hotel was great and had awesome staff.  They were very helpful and helped us with all of our needs.  Our only regret is that we wish we would of gotten a hotel closer to the fisherman's wharf.  The hotel is located close to union square shopping. The only down side we found is, the money that we saved on our hotel room was lost in transportation down to the wharf.

ReviewText:The hotel was nicely situated a block from Union Square - so convenient but not quite as crowded right around the hotel.      The room was quite nice, and the staff was helpful with a number of small requests for help.      The lobby bar is set up in an unusual way, but it worked for us.  There are all manner of seating areas - tables, couches, and even little areas with a tv, table and chairs, as if set up for an informal meeting.  We spent a comfortable happy hour in one of these areas - private and relaxing for a hotel bar.
