ReviewText:This old classically beautiful hotel was a wonderful experience. Nice amenities, comfortable beds, and a beautiful lounge and restaurant. The value was great for the location, too.

ReviewText:Made same day reservations and arrived early and to our surprise our room was ready and waiting. Ruben at the front desk made us feel right at home. Staff was very friendly and we loved their "my pleasure" attitude.

ReviewText:Good hotel in downtown SF. Many fractures but can be expensive for some people, paid for internet, breakfast and other services. Overall, it was good stay.

ReviewText:In the perfect location, close to everything in downtown San Francisco. The pool is very nice, and the gym is small, but effective. The beds in our room was ridiculously comfortable. They have a restaurant downstairs which is glamorous to say the least. They have a $85 Saturday brunch, which is well worth the money. -newline-  -newline- We decided to splurge a little to get this hotel, and it was well worth the money.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a good location and has a very "old, classy SF" feel to it. I've stayed here a couple of times with no issues, but this last time was a bit of a disappointment. There was no TP (only the roll that was there when we go to the room). We could also hear the guests in the next room in the morning. Lastly, the parking situation was a bit confusing-if you valet its a lot more versus parking in the garage (across the street) yourself.

ReviewText:I really like beds and amenities in this hotel. In fact I always stay there when I travel to San Francisco. But what is increasingly annoying is the speed of wifi - I cannot watch any of the netflix of hbogo on Palace's network unless I plug in into ethernet at the desk which is not convenient at all.

ReviewText:We were only in for a one night stay with my kids for a concert and everything was wonderful. The staff were so helpful and the place was very convenient to everything. I highly recommend it.

ReviewText:we had horrible experience at that hotel. Had drinking party going on in the room next door. Call hotel reception at 2am and again at 3 am to ask them to do something since nobody could sleep. They didn't do anything. Had to get up 4 am next morning for our flight. We will NEVER again stay in this hotel. We felt that they don't care about their guests.
