ReviewText:To be in La Jolla, CA one block from the beach and a 10 min walk from downtown eating and shopping and not spend a bunch on the room this is the place. The staff is wonderful, jacuzzi nice and good free coffee in the morning. It ain't the Ritz but it's comfy.

ReviewText:Older hotel but was updated and very clean. Pool and spa area, ice machine/soda machines,laundry area well maintained and clean. Good variety of breakfast foods. Staff was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was quiet and non-invasive. Great location! Several restaurants, cafes,barber/hair salon,consignment store located near or next to hotel. Bus stop in front and across the street. Can get to the village by a short bus ride or a 30 minute walk. An emergency walk-in clinic is located a block away. The beach is located one block down from the hotel. Lovely residental area surrounds the hotel. We will return. This hotel is a hidden Jewel.

ReviewText:From the time we arrived the stay was near perfect. I only say near perfect because we didn't stay long enough. Walked to the beach, ate across the street at the mentioned Mexican restaurant and relaxed in the spa before calling it a night. Will be back as soon as possible.

ReviewText:Incredible location at an extremely affordable rate. The beautful beach is a 2 min walk down the hill and a there is a nice coffee shop next door. They offered a 25% discount at a Mexican restaurant next door - I didn't go there but it looked good. This hotel is very basic, but it is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I left two power cords in the room and they called me and helped me to get them back.

ReviewText:Clean, comfortable, economical rooms just a short walk from a beautiful beach. Great Mexican restaurant and nice coffee shop right beside motel. Everything else in LaJolla nearby. This is where I'll stay next time I'm in the area.

ReviewText:I don't go to San Diego to sit in my room, or go to the pool, so this place was perfect. A block from the beach, close to the shops, clean and quaint. I will definitely be back! Thanks!
