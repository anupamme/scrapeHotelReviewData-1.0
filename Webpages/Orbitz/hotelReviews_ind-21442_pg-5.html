ReviewText:The hotel's staff were great. I loved the hotel facilities. The free breakfast was awesome but we had to stand in a long line for an hour to get it. Well if you love kids and long lines and crowded pool (including almost everywhere in hotel), you gonna love the place. Our other problem was the train station which was too close and it's horn was so laud (it continued every hour till 1:00 am.). I loved the interior design and the rooms. But next time I would go with a less crowded or at least less kid's popular hotel.

ReviewText:Went to San Diego to go to the beach and the county fair -- a quick weekend trip.  It was within walking distance to the Gaslamp District and Fisherman's Village, which was ideal.  There's unlimited free cocktails from 5:30PM-7:30PM and a free hot breakfast buffet.  These are pluses, but the parking is $25 a night and the room is fairly pricey.  Good for families, but uninspiring for others.  But clean, comfortable, perfect in a middle-of-the-road kind of way.

ReviewText:The location of this hotel is ideal for sight seeing in San Diego.  It offers the ability to walk to the sights along the bayside and marina area.  The hotel  lobby area was very nice. The breakfast area seemed a bit dated. The buffet breakfast food was always cold, so opt for something from the griddle. The food service staff were the nicest people at the hotel. The concierge was less than genuinely friendly, however she delivered accurate information on getting to La Jolla and Coronado Island (must see). The recommended car rental at the hotel was outstanding, but stand by for the steep valet charges.  My room had older furniture and the vanity in the bathroom doubled as the AC intake, and was in dire need of replacement.  Overall this hotel was not as nice as the previous Embassy Suites I have visited (Orlando and West Palm Beach FL).

ReviewText:Hotel was within walking distance to USS Midway Museum, across the street to Seaport Village/trolley stop.  Excellent breakfast buffet would have paid around $20 pp some where else with two teenagers.  Mangers reception  every nite was great-just what was needed after a busy day of sightseeing.  Highly recommend this hotel-If you are facing the street recommend you just close window at night-cars and pedestrian traffic. -newline- We did the trolley tour-great city overview and on and off stops, Petco Park, Old Town, Little Italy, USS Midway , Seal Harbour tours.
