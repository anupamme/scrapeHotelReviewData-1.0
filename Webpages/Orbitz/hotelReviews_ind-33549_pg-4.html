ReviewText:A great place to stay when in Seattle. We met our friends, our cars were parked for us, our rooms were ready, the staff was great, the complimentary wine was good, and we were within a short walk to a great restaurat ...The Brooklyn. What more could we ask!

ReviewText:Incredible location, just blocks from Pike Place Market and a block from the ferries and waterfront.  Very good restaurants inside the hotel (and lovely decor all around) and pets are welcome.  Helpful and friendly staff; great parking service.  My only complaint is that the rooms facing 1st Avenue are the noisiest I've ever been in.  Shouting, car racing, and clinking from the flag poles outside our window kept us up off and on throughout the night.  WAY too noisy, even for the soundest of sleepers.  Also, the gym machines need to be tended to.  Other than those two things, this hotel is delightful all the way around.

ReviewText:Loved the decor and look. Staff was very friendly. Only drawback was limited dining options in hotel and gym was basically just a room with two treadmills. The hotel does provide free passes to a Gold's gym a few blocks away. Free coffee and water in lobby and a free wine hour every night. Def was worth the money and highly recommend it. Room service was quick and had some well prepared high quality choices, yet was reasonably priced. I

ReviewText:At the end of a professional conference, we took two days for pleasure and stayed at the Alexis. We'd been there before, and it was just as nice this time. It's our go-to place in Seattle.

ReviewText:Hotel staff was very friendly and accomadating during our stay, we had some special request and they were met promptly.  The room was huge and tastefully decorated. The location was great and centrally located for all the attractions we wanted to see while in town. I would highly recommend this hotel.
