ReviewText:Very comfortable room, quiet hallways, convenient location. Only complaint was shower area that had a slight mildew odor. I think that is likely due to the prevailing moist air in the area. Overall, great experience!

ReviewText:Had a great experience at Stanford Court, from initial arrival to adding an extra night and staying in the same room. The concierge was helpful with any questions we had. Also all 3 cable car stops are right in front of the hotel which will take you down to fishermans wharf or ghiradelli square or down california street. Only a 3 block walk down to union square as well so excellent location. Only reason for 4 stars was because the hotel did not have a pool or hot tub (we knew this when booking though) which would have been nice after a day of walking or biking the bridge.

ReviewText:My daughter and I stayed here while loooking at colleges. The staff was warm and attentive, and the hotel was beautiful. We loved that we were right next to the Fairmnt and Mark Hopkins hotel, but were paying FAR less for our room. Convenient to so many of the great sites San Francisco has to offer, including being right on the cable car line. Outstanding value.

ReviewText:Perfect hotel in an excellent location minutes from Union Square. Tram stop directly outside hotel to various points of interest within the city. Friendly, helpful staff and free bicycle use as part of your stay. Would not hesitate to return to this vibrant city with fabulous restaurants and bars. Stanford Court is the perfect Hotel and would recommend to all.

ReviewText:This Hotel was in an amazing location but it is on top of a very steep hill. If you are looking for a great workout on your trip this is the PERFECT hotel for you. Besides the my legs burning everytime we came back to our hotel everything was great.

ReviewText:You can tell the hotel was old and had just been revamped. Loved the hipster yet antique look of the hotel. The beds were so comfy! The bathroom had towel heater racks which was pretty cool. Didn't really work though. Would def stay again. Staff were nice and friendly. Location was great if you're like me and don't mind the excercise. One straight road down and you hit the city centee, on each side is Chinatown and little Saigon. Very good location.

ReviewText:The Stanford Court is a true San Francisco experience. The rooms are lovely and well laid out, we had a great view of the Bay and Transamerica Pyramid, and we could dinging of the cable cars down below. However, you do get an unintentional extreme hill work out every time you leave and came back -- those views come at a price! Other pros: close to the delight of Chinatown, the cable car museum, shopping at Union Square, and there are great breakfasts in the lobby restaurant.
