ReviewText:The hotel was located on a beautiful private bay. They only have one pool and hot tub, which was full of young adult drinkers. The Beds were small (full) and very uncomfortable. The resort had activities for the children during the day on Saturday, and also a free arcade room. The resort is within walking distance from Mission Beach, and a public bay. The one restaurant located at the resort was over priced, and the food was below average. It wasn't terrible, but we won't be going back.

ReviewText:To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when we booked this hotel because it was so much less expensive than others in the area. I figured, you get what you pay for. I was so pleasantly surprised that although the exterior of the hotel is a bit retro, the interiors were AMAZING. We had a mini-suite and it was updated with beautiful finishes and we had plenty of room. The beds were comfortable, I wanted to steal their pillows - so heavenly! My one and only complaint was that there was no room for our ice cream in the tiny freezer shelf in the mini-fridge. Next time, we'll have to eat all of our ice cream ahead of time.

ReviewText:Was told that we would be getting a garden suite, well let me tell you, this is not a suite. The description said that we would be having a sofa bed but that was not in our suite. -newline-  -newline- On the plus, we asked for a microwave and baby crib and were provided them fairly quickly.

ReviewText:I wanted to get away by myself to relax and work on some personal projects. I loved the view of the bay and the walking along the beach. The room had everything that I wanted so I didn't have to go anywhere once I got supplies for the mini kitchen. The room was big enough to workout in and really comfortable!!!

ReviewText:We desided to stay in SD last minute, I'd like to think we got a great deal. Everything went smooth and great, the front desk was not quite ready for us to check in, so they gave us the passes for the boat ride and allowed us to check in after. Our room was nice, with the exception of trash still in the trash can under the sink and some trash under the pull out couch bed.

ReviewText:I was very pleasantly surprised to check into our room. Not only was it huge, but our private deck overlooked the bay - what a great view to wake up to. A great value and great location. I would highly recommend and definitely return for another stay.

ReviewText:I think we were set up in staff lodging quarters. We would receive communications under our door addressed to staff. There was out of place furniture in our room that appeared to be there as storage. The couch had several tears in it. The bathroom was dirty. The location of our room was right outside of the elevator and above the garbage dumpster. There was no such thing as a restful sleep. There was another guests dirty dishes from room service outside of our door from the time we arrived on our first day until the next day.
