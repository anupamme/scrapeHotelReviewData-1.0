ReviewText:Capital Hill, Downtown, First Hill and Belltown all within walking distance, can't be beat. Will stay here again. Staff not very friendly is the only down point.

ReviewText:The hotel was lovely, very clean and comfortable, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice fitness room. We didn't want to stay in downtown Seattle, and this location was perfect - an easy walkable distance to downtown (and hotel runs a shuttle if you don't feel like walking) but in the fun and funky neighborhood of Capitol HIll; lots of restaurants, bars, amazingly great bookstore, ice cream etc, nearby. The hotel restaurant, "Jimmy's" is a bit pricey, but the food is good. There's also a big upscale QFC supermarket down the street, and so with a fridge in the room, we made some of our own breakfasts and snacks. You can also buy an ORCA card (for the bus) at the QFC.

ReviewText:ok hotel in a good location, but with tax it comes to $250 a night and then to add insult to injury they charge you $20 a night for parking. Many better deals in Seattle and I got stuck with this because I didn't reserve far enough ahead. sigh.

ReviewText:I always stay here when visiting Seattle University. It's clean, great staff (!), has huge rooms, microwave, fridge, two separate areas to get ready, good water pressure in the showers, etc. -newline-  -newline- It's not a resort. It's a well maintained hotel with professional staff. I'm not looking for a spa experience when visiting, I'm looking for quality, cleanliness, safety etc. -newline-  -newline- Parking garage is secure and safe-- well lit and locked gates provide good security for cars and people. -newline-  -newline- Jimmy's on Broadway restaurant also has great food for reasonable prices. Walking distance to many, many other choices as well.

ReviewText:Came in for a conference downtown, and was looking for a cheaper option than the big high-rises. This hotel combined comfortable rooms with funky location, in a hip neighborhood full of bars and bookstores...
