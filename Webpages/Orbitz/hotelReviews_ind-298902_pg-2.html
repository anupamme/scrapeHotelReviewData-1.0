ReviewText:This was our second stay here. It's close to the subway and train station. During this stay we realized everything was in walking distance. Learn something about the city with every stay. Staff is super nice and helpful. Our flight wasn't leaving until 7pm and the hotel held our bags in a locked closet while went spent the day in the city!

ReviewText:We were not looking for luxury, but we were surprised to find that the hotel is located in an unexpectedly seedy area of Boston. Entering and leaving the hotel, drunks and panhandlers are there to greet you. From our room there was a "view" of the blank wall of the Boston Gardens stadium. Past the drunks it was a fifteen minute walk to Long Wharf. Granted the free breakfast was good and the room was clean. Even so, the price for the room was much higher -- perhaps double -- what one would expect for this type of accommodation.

ReviewText:For a $230.00 a night room, plus another $39.00 for valet parking, I would expect NOT to be bitten by BED BUGS! Attention all travelers - if you like to stay in a room and NOT be bitten by bed bugs AVOID THIS HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS! -newline-  -newline- What a disappointment ... as a former employee of many Holiday Inn properties across the United States, I am attuned to the standards required of the individual Holiday Inn properties. My room was a complete failure of meeting Holiday Inn standards. Chipped and scratched furniture. Saggy mattress. A lamp that did not work. Moldy-smelling bathroom. Stained bath towels. Dirty carpets. Plus bed bug bites to cap off a lousy room stay. I will tell everyone I know that, if they are ever to visit Boston, to avoid the Holiday Inn Express Boston Garden like the plague. I am embarassed for the owner of this property.

ReviewText:Well my girlfriend and I were vacationing in Boston and were planning to leave on Sunday. However we decided to stay one more day and needed a hotel room fast. I looked on [...]and found this Holiday Inn Express. Since we arrived late, we really didn't go anywhere but the hotel. However we did notice a pub right below which would've been perfect to chill if we had wanted to. The room was small but since we only needed it to sleep I found it great. The room had a flat screen TV and the bed was very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel if you just needed a place to sleep. I mean, we were visiting so no point in getting an expensive room if you are going to be traveling through the streets of Boston. Thumbs Up!
