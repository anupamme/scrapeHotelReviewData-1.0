ReviewText:Beautiful, historic building. Wonderful location. Check in slow due to only having one staff person, but she was very good. Nice room, but no in-room coffee. Food in restaurant WAY over-priced ( had a conversation in the elevator with a couple carrying McDonald's breakfast about $12 bacon and eggs and $6.50 coffee). And in the 21st century, having to pay for in-room wi-fi is a problem.

ReviewText:The Palace Hotel is a good value. Significantly cheaper nightly rate than most of the other 4 star hotels in the financial district. Clean rooms, great service. The atrium restaurant is beautiful and the bar is great. Its an old hotel (+/-150 years?), but that adds character and prestige, not a detriment -- long history of many past presidents and heads of state have stayed there. Highly recommend.

ReviewText:Ideally located next to Montgomery Street BART station for this storied pre-1906 hotel. Truly grand in all respects although the modest sized rooms, additional wi-fi charges, and limited soundproofing between rooms might be a problem for some. That said, this is an exceptional hotel experience.

ReviewText:Location: walking distance to wharf or Little Italy (long walk, but that is SF), financial district and Union Square. Clean, nice area of town. -newline-  -newline- Staff: Very nice, professional staff. Definitely attempt to maintain a European atmosphere. We are a younger couple, but staff treated us as well as the typically older clientele. -newline-  -newline- Atmosphere: Very nice- but definitely a historical, antique style. Seems to aim for French-bourgeoisie/provincial style. Starwood Property so there is a strong brand behind the hotel- plus you can earn points. -newline-  -newline- Room: Clean and sufficient. Not "modern", but rooms have been updated. Definitely a nice, well maintained property (did not feel "old" like other SF hotels). We were in a basic, King bedroom. Had a fridge- always a plus after Little Italy pizza!

ReviewText:Hi, the halls of hotel were constantly full of dirty plates; all day long. Some of the furniture in the hotel were damaged; the tv was blurry; there was visible mold in the bathroom tile; the shower/tub did not drain properly. -newline-  -newline- Should I go on??? this is a 4 or 5 star hotel? Hardly.
