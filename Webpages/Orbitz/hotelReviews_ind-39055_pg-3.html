ReviewText:We had a wonderful stay at the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins. Fabulous location, friendly and attentive staff and an excellent room for the price we paid. The only thing missing here are amenities such as a gift shop for those forgotten essentials and a pool. Given the historic nature of the property the lack of the pool is understandable. The Fairmont next door has a gift shop but it would be nice not to have to dash across the street. Other than that, great experience here and would certainly stay again!

ReviewText:Very, very clean and neat. Staff was great with directions and assistance. Booked our city tour and things went off without a hitch. Would stay at this hotel again if the price was less expensive.

ReviewText:Great location! Cable car stops nearby. The Top of the Mark bar at the top of the hotel has a great view of the city. Close to Chinatown and the Ferry Building Marketplace that has a lot of great restaurants, especially The Slanted Door!

ReviewText:We paid $162 per night, which is a great deal for San Francisco. (Beware of those $110 to $130 SF hotels, research the location & read reviews before booking). Parking was expensive, about $58 per night. I'm not sure what the average price for overnight parking is in the area - you might be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. -newline- The hotel was nice: beautiful lobby, clean rooms. The view from The Top of the Mark is amazing. The waiters were a bit slow, but everyone was friendly.

ReviewText:The InterContinental Mark Hopkins at Nob Hill is a stately, elegant hotel with great service, classic appointments, a "peak" location, and fantasticly comfortable beds. -newline-  -newline- Some parts of the hotel are a little tired #I'm always a little grossed out by scarred woodwork that's been repainted over and over - but this IS an older hotel so it's really not indicative of anything untoward...# and I wish these folks would provide free wifi. On the other hand, the free coffee in the lobby in the morning is a nice perk.
