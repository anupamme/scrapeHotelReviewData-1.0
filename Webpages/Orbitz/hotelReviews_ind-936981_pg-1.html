ReviewText:the room has no refridgerator. There was only a fair amount of cleaning done to the room. Dust in the corners, vents, and window sills. Didn't look like a vacum had been in the room for a while. Waking up the first morning there was no hot water. I spoke to the staff and got a luke warm "sorry". Nothing else.

ReviewText:The room is very small and the bathroom is terribly tight to move around. The room needs renovation and the furniture is very old. The room finish is archaic and needs renovation. The carpet is old and needs to be refreshed. For all this money, where is the closet? -newline- I consider this hotel is the worst value for the money. The only positive thing about this hotel is its location and free breakfast.

ReviewText:This old hotel has charm. The rooms and bathrooms are small but adequate. The location is great and the amenities for the 15th floor are nice. Hors d'oeuvres and breakfast were included. We got a good deal on an average room and enjoyed our 1 night stay. The hotel did not have our reservation from cheap tickets but did honor it once I forwarded my confirmation.

We hade 2 separate bookings with your company: for 9/6/13 for 1 night and 10/6/13 for 1 night for the same hotel.

ReviewText:Overall, I liked this hotel but it is clearly old and a little tired. My room was a decent size, but the bathroom was tiny and, quite honestly, smelled. Right when I got there, I opened the window due to subtle but gross smell of bacteria. It turned out it was the toilet. The lobby is tired. Still, my room was up to date and free wireless was nice. They also gave me a complimentary breakfast. I would stay there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

ReviewText:Hotel is in a good location for the price however I was VERY dissapointed in the overall experience. The elevators were jam packed and then the doors would close on you when getting out. Some guests had to wait 20 mins to get to the lobby. The walls are paper thin in the rooms. Rooms are generally clean but old (aside from bathroom renovation) and are not impressive what so ever. The from desk employees were helpful but they were serverly understaffed for a Saturday. I recommend paying an extra $50-80 to stay in a better run / more modern hotel. Wish I had!

ReviewText:Hotel was pretty average and the hotel staff not that helpful. -newline- We stayed on the 15th floor where they have a private lounge where they serve breakfast and hors d'oeuvres, both of which were pathetic! Unless you would show up right at the beginning they would run out of stuff and never replenish, plus the food quality was pretty average. -newline- Overall the location was excellent but everything else was average, so if you get a good rate then I would recommend this hotel, if not, stay somewhere else.
