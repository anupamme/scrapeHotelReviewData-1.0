ReviewText:The best feature about this hotel is its location a few blocks from the Windansea surf break. The staff is very helpful and the hotel has a pool, spa and coin laundry. Its also located next to a great Mexican hotel. The hotel is older and the room is dated, with an old tube style TV, older wallpaper and an itchy felt blanket, but is acceptably clean. Overall the value is good if you want to be close to the beach in La Jolla.

ReviewText:The motel was an excellent value for the price. My wife and I saved over $100 per night compared to other motels and hotels in the neighborhood.The room was clean (as was the motel as a whole) and bright. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and and courteous. The motel is located just 2 blocks from the beach. We will definitely stay there when next in the area.

ReviewText:This Travelodge is an extremely good value for the money. Everything is extremely clean, the rooms I stayed in both this stay and during a previous stay in January were very comfortable, and the staff members were friendly and accommodating both times I stayed there. The pool and laundary facilities are a bonus in a hotel in this price range. My only minor complaint is that the parking is tight in the parking lot. One night there were no spots available in the parking lots to the motel itself, but I was able to find a (free) spot on the street right in front. Excellent value for the money.

ReviewText:I went to San Diego for a 4-day conference at an expensive hotel in La Jolla. I liked the location of this travelodge right next to the beach and that it was only 10 minutes away from the expensive hotel. Has all the amenities I needed. Unbeatable for the price!!

ReviewText:I felt very comfortable and safe at this "neighborhood" motel. The rooms are small, but mine was very clean. All the staff were welcoming and pleasant. There was no need for a car with Bird Rock and La Jolla Village just a mile walk away. The coffee shop right next door was perfect for conversation and great bagels, sandwiches and homemade soup. The sunsets at WindanSea Beach just two blocks from the Lodge were priceless. I'll be back!
