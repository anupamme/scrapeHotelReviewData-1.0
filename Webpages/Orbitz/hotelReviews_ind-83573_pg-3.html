ReviewText:For the money, I thought the room was too small and the ac didn't work very well, thankfully it is SF so it doesn't get that hot. Our view was literally a building wall with privacy glass on the window so it isn't as obvious. Thought the staff was less than helpful when asking for anything. Overall for the money, I would rather pay extra or be a little further from the water and have a nicer hotel room.

ReviewText:After a long day of travel the quiet and unobtrusive front desk process was a welcome change from the usual hubbub. The room was cozy and well appointed, the dining was casual and delectable, the front desk knowledgeable and helpful, the location safe and picturesque, and the overall experience comfortable.
