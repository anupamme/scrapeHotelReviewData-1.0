ReviewText:This Hilton location strikes a nice balance between access and seclusion. It's two blocks from Faneuil Hall and three from the Aquarium and the rest of the waterfront attractions. This makes it an easy walk to either while not having to absorb the constant horns from the tour boats or crowd noise. -newline-  -newline- It's surrounded by bars, coffee shops and restaurants, so there's no problem with finding a spot for food or drink. The hotel staff seems invested in making sure you're doing well and we enjoyed their assistance. -newline-  -newline- The only knock against them, which will not be one for many, was the lack of wired Internet access. We use WiFi just like everyone else, but we also have a wired travel router we use for our business security and we were unable to use that here. For a business hotel in the financial district, I think it's something worth maintaining. -newline-  -newline- Overall, we really enjoyed staying here. They had everything (almost) we needed in the room, and the stay was smooth and pleasant.

ReviewText:This hotel was the perfect location for a fun night out in Boston. It is within walking distance of a lot of great bars/restaurants in the area as well as Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The room was comfortable and clean. We will definitely be staying there again in the future.

ReviewText:A few blocks from the T. Staff are all helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. A tad expensive but all hotels in Boston are overpriced

ReviewText:Disappointing. Upon check-in we asked for directions to a nearby restaurant and how to get to the fireworks. The young lady said she was new to the area & didn't know. No luck at the information desk as it was empty. The room was a little cramped. The bathroom sink faucet leaked and the drain in the shower didn't work. Great bartender. Unfortunately, won't return.

ReviewText:My friend and I stayed for just one night as a last minute resort and we both were very pleased. The room was beautiful and very clean. I loved how nice and clean the bathroom was. The hotel is located in a perfect spot for anyone wanting to experience Boston. Not to mention the price of the hotel room was very reasonable :) xoxo

ReviewText:Great hotel and even better staff. They were kind and accomodating. The only issue was that it was loud in the morning due to vacuuming outside of our room. The location was excellent and everything was walkable!
