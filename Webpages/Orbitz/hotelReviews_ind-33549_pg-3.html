ReviewText:Check in was very easy. I was able to check in early. Staff was very helpful. The bed was firmer then I expected. The location was great within walking distance to almost everything. Parking was complicated due to it being extremely busy so a festival going on in town. Would recommend using the valet service so you don't have the hassle I did with parking. Would stay at this hotel again.

ReviewText:Aside from a few detailing the room could have used by the cleaning staff (water marks on the sink, refill the shampoo dispensers), my stay was quite excellent. It is a pet-friendly hotel, which I've never experienced. Just be warned, if you have an allergy, this place is probably not for you. -newline-  -newline- The elevators smelled a little like dog urine... No biggie, you're only in it for a few seconds. -newline-  -newline- The best thing about the place is the staff, which are exceedingly helpful. Absolutely top notch. -newline-  -newline- Pike place market is just a few blocks away, a very easy walk with no incline. Forget the car rental if you are just doing city sights, public transit and taxis are fine.

ReviewText:Situated in an ideal spot in downtown Seattle, near local attractions and wonderful restaurants, this hotel is well appointed and very comfortable. The service is superior, the LIbrary Bookstore Bistro is cozy and the food is wonderful. A quiet getaway in a bustling city.

ReviewText:The entire staff was very accomodating. We we're upgraded to a suite when we checked in and we were given champagne and chocolate covered strawberries after our arrival. The hotel restaurant was delicious and had a huge selection of whiskey (which is our favorite). The room was very well maintained and spotless.

ReviewText:Our trip to seattle was short but fun perfect little retreat from anchorage. The location was perfect, Pikes Street Market, Pioneer square, Macys, Peer 50 water taxi, we did take a taxi to the Space Needle but could of walked all were within walking distance of this hotel, there was plenty of places to eat & drink, finding a place to eat breakfest was the most diffacult but was able to do so at the Sounder in the market place. the hotel staff was great very helpfull & genuine with their niceness, allthough the hotel was nice and confortable some of the dresser drawer handles were loose & the toilet roll holder was loose from the wall, other than that I would recomend this hotel to other.
