ReviewText:I enjoyed my stay here very much, thanks to the great service and facilities. The location in Union Square is unbeatable, and the room was pristine and tastefully decorated. This hotel is great for business and leisure travel alike, and suitable for both single and group/family travel.

ReviewText:This hotel is conveniently located to union square and tons of shopping. Easy walk to china town and little Italy. All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Check in was easy and my room was even available earlier than stated check in.

ReviewText:Hotel bed very comfy. We wanted to take the beds with us. Everything was clean. We felt very welcome. Since we did not come with our luggages, they provided us with necessary toiletries. We really appreciate their hospitality.

ReviewText:Good service and comfortable stay in San Francisco. Short walk to Union Square and Macy's store. Booked a Level 3 room, we would book a higher floor in future as some street noise in our room but a pleasant stay overall.

ReviewText:Great location to walk around Union Square. Check-in was quick, rooms larger than most in SF. We booked a club room with two double beds and it was worth the price. I loved the cappuccino machine! Freshly-made scrambled eggs every morning with assorted toppings! Lots of fresh fruit and bakery options as well. Rooms have all been renovated and have modern amenities- loved the rainfall shower heads & remote control black- out shades. I'll be back :)
