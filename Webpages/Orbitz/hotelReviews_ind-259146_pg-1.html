ReviewText:I had the feeling they were nickel and diming me at every opportunity. $4 for a bottle of water. $15 to watch a movie. Pay for Wi-Fi, and anything else you need. I'll try another hotel next time.

ReviewText:Very pleasant time and very comfortable room. Great bed!!! Picked this location as it was a short taxi ride to a wonderful restaurant called Prezza, and another short ride to the airport next day. Would stay here again.

ReviewText:My boyfriend and I first arrived in the morning on a Thursday and thought we'd have to just beg the hotel front desk to hold our bags, so that we could go out for the day before checking in. However, I approached the desk and informed the clerk that we had arrived and began to ask if she'd be able to hold our bags until check-in time. Instead of just saying "sure," she told us that they had a few rooms with double beds but no king-sized ones. I was thrilled. We're not terrifically picky people and would be perfectly comfortable on a double, so we said sure. I was just happy that we could check in early. -newline-  -newline- All in all, the whole experience was positive. The staff was friendly, the location was near good restaurants, bars, and Harpoon Brewery (if you like beer, go!), and the rooms were very clean. Also, the hotel is located just across the street from the water, so we ended up with a bit of a view. -newline-  -newline- And, when we were there, it wasn't noisy. Something I totally hate is when I can hear everything going on outside of my room. I'm not sure if it was because we just didn't have any obnoxious people around or what, but our stay was pretty quiet. This is not to say that it's a boring type of hotel at all. On the contrary, it's near some really fun, late-night places. For whatever reason, it just wasn't annoyingly loud. -newline-  -newline- Oh! I almost forgot. There is a Starbucks downstairs! I didn't have to roam around the streets looking for coffee...I had it downstairs from my room! If you need your coffee like I do, you'll realize why that was so exciting for me. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in Boston.

ReviewText:Great hotel! Very clean and very nice staff. If you are looking to be more downtown in the Faniel Hall area or Fenway Park then it's a little bit out of the way (but you can take the subway "T" over there). Overall, a very nice hotel that is a little pricy but it is a 4 star hotel!

ReviewText:The location of this hotel is fantastic! I had the 11th floor and had the view of the Boston harbor from my window. The room are clean and in great shape. Public transportation is right across the street and many restaurants are within walkable distance.

ReviewText:My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Renissance Waterf'ront Hotel. The staff was friendly and accommodated our request for a King-size bed upon checking in. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The location was awesome. We would gladly stay there again!
