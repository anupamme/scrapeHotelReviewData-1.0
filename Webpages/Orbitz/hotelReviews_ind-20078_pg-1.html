ReviewText:This is our second trip to this hotel...it's fantastic! The location is awesome! It's right in the center of the Gaslamp District and Padres stadium. The staff is super nice and so helpful. My husband and I like to walk, so Seaport Village and the U.S.S. Midway is a pleasant half hour walk along the harbor. We really enjoy the multitude of things to do and the resturant selection in the Gaslamp.

ReviewText:This hotel is a great structure and on it's way up. The staff is super to deal with and the building beautiful. it falls short on amenities and details. Coming soon is room service and work out facility, but not there yet. The bath could use some meticulous cleaning in the corners and straightening or towel bars, etc. The sheets show wear with pilling on the pillow cases. I hope to check back in a year or two to see if this hotel lives up to its potential

ReviewText:We are repeat customers at the Horton because of its location, and we like its unique vintage character. We can walk to the places we want (Petco Park, USS Midway, MTS Trolley) and avoid renting a car and paying the $30 daily parking fee. Cab fare to Balboa Park is around $10. New breakfast buffet is tasty and a reasonable price for the convenience ($12.95). Staff is friendly and helpful. Fourth floor courtyard is the quietest area, as Horton's location also brings noise from the Gaslamp District. Staff willingly relocated us after a first noisy night on the second floor (we were courtyard but had noisy neighbors, and the walls must be thin.) Next two nights were heavenly on a very comfy bed with elegant linens. Rooms are small but furnishings are new and in character with the hotel's vintage style. We would make a return visit.

ReviewText:This is an OK hotel with a great location. It's historic in that the original hotel was relocated brick by brick when they built the Horton Plaza mall a couple of blocks away and reassembled (old hotel smell and all) in its current location. It has an old west feel to it but I'd trade the plastic horse in the lobby and Victorian trimmings for more power points in the room and a more comfortable bed. The location is great..it's firmly in the gaslamp quarter...most of what you might want is a short drunken stumble from the hotel. Parking is $30 and valet only which is about the norm downtown. Breakfast at $12 is comparable with what you would get for free at a Holiday Inn Express or Springfield. If you don't need the luxury don't mind the old lady smell and can get this for a decent price you will be fine.

ReviewText:The Horton Grand Hotel wasa great place to stay for our girls weekeend in June. The hotel is right in the middle of Glaslamp District of San Diego. Everything is within blocks of the hotel including the marina, great bars, and resteraunts. In great proximity to the MTS there light rail system so you can easily get to other regions of San Diego. The room was great we had a balcony that overlooked the streets. Room was nicely furnished and the hotel has a great atrium area accessible to all guests. The hotel staff was great at giving suggestions as well as letting us check in early! Great deal and great place to stay!

ReviewText:Did a Ghost Line Tours a year back and the Horton was on the stop. For that reason it had stuck in my head. It is located in the gaslamp district. so if you are planning on getting your drink on, it is ideal for just parking and stumbling around for a lost weekend or two. I was there on a family outing so we did some travel from there. Everything was about 15-20 minutes away so it was great. The room we got was a good size mini suite. there were five of us so we got a roll away. Slept well. Room was clean but never restocked, that was a drag. had a fridge and a microwave- definitely a plus. staff was great. front desk helped us get the right room. parking attendants very cool. felt bad because i couldn't tip as i was literally cashless the entire stay. they didn't blink an eye, but i felt they deserved a tip better than a 'thank you' whch was all i could offer.

ReviewText:The hotel was so beautiful with all the framed pictures, antiques, wooden grand stairways. The staff were all friendly & very helpful. We had a balcony overlooking the hotel courtyard that had trees and comfy sofas and chairs. Our room had a fireplace to add to the ambience of the room. And you leave the hotel walk onto fourth and fifth Street where all the action is. With. restaurants & shops of Gaslamp Village. It was just wonderful,we loved it.
