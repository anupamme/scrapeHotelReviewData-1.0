ReviewText:We have stayed at this hotel several times. We love it because it's perfect for families! The staff is always courteous and the amenities are great! The only thing was that the last two times we went the jacuzzi was not in service.

ReviewText:Iloved everything about this hotel, especially the room(s), but you pay extra to park, wifi, and it starts to add up. Could have stayed at other hotels by the time ALL the extras were added in.

ReviewText:Dislikes first, Stayed twice. One time rented car, second, took cab. As close as it is to the airport they should have an airport shuttle. However, a cab ride is about $16.00 plus tip which is a good price. I've paid more than that for hotel shuttles at other hotels so it's not a huge complaint. -newline-  -newline- My biggest gripe was $30 for overnight parking. I've never seen a rate nearly that high at any other hotel. It's a rip-off. I parked overnight on the street for free a block from the hotel. I will never pay $30!!! -newline-  -newline- Things we liked. Great room, staff very helpful and courteous. My family loves the full breakfast. The location is excellent.

ReviewText:I have stayed at embassy suites in other states and they have never let me down . the rooms are always clean and breakfast is always good . this hotel was in a great location , 10 or 20 minute walk to shopping , food or entertainment . it was also close to the boat tours . the only thing that would make it perfect is free parking , but parking downtown in any city you have to pay ..
