ReviewText:Can not ask for a better location or a more magnificent view. Stayed here for the biotech convention and had excellent access to convention center and the GasLamp district. Only issue was no complimentary coffee in lobby area due to the Starbucks in the hotel. Otherwise, the access to the waterfront and the rest of the city, tied with the great Hilton brand make this a winner.

ReviewText:Very clean, friendly and pretty new (within the last couple of years it seems like). Right on the bay, I would def stay again. Close to Gaslamp Quarter. Take the Ferry to Coronado Beach from right in front of the hotel.

ReviewText:This was a great hotel. Rooms were clean and friendly staff. The pool was crowded with kids during the daytime, but it was nice at night. I also liked that this hotel is pet friendly. It only cost one $50 pet cleaning fee for the entire stay. However, the self parking for $30 a night is ridiculous. That should be included for the hotel guests.

ReviewText:Went for a weekend getaway. I think it was a bit chaotic. The pool was open to people not even staying at the hotel so it was way overcrowded. -newline- It was within walking distance to the gas lamp quarters and all the dinning so that was good. There were plenty of food options. -newline- We did order room service, for what was received, way over priced. Side of fruit for $7.00 consisted of about 7 pieces of bite sized fruit. -newline- The bed was super uncomfortable. My husband and I both woke up with back pain from tossing and turning around. I think for what you pay, it should be excellent..... but it definitely lacks the '4' star quality it claims to be.
