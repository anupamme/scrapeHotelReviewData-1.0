ReviewText:Nice boutique hotel in SF. Room was nice and comfortable. No ice machines, need to order from front desk. Parking is overpriced at $50.00 per night.

ReviewText:I have a small paranoia of bugs and cleanliness when I stay in places that I do not know. I did the usual checks and found no signs of bed bugs for those that are paranoid as well. -newline-  -newline- Pros - The rooms were mostly clean, it was freshly vacuumed and new sheets were put on. The colors were very welcoming and made the room feel very homey. -newline-  -newline- Cons - There was some moisture mold on the window sill behind the desk. Probably one of the more neglected areas because of its location. The bathroom was satisfactory. The shower looked like a normal tub and even had some of the porcelain coming off in areas. Definitely not as nice as if could have been. -newline-  -newline- Overall a nice stay with some little details that need to be looked at by the staff. I will most likely not be staying here again.

ReviewText:Enjoyed the location and the ambience of the hotel and my room....think the Vallet parking is too expensive given there is a garage next door that is half the cost. -newline-  -newline- But all else was good!

ReviewText:Great location and friendly staff. Unfortunately, there are some inconsistencies that are very dis-appointing, e.g. hotel is charging for WiFi and $6 for a coffee when consumed at their breakfast restaurant (it's for FREE if you help yourself in the lobby!!!)

ReviewText:I was recently stayed here for a birthday get away with some friends of ours. The staff was very friendly and the hotel is in very GREAT location which added lots of convenience to wonder around the city for tourist attraction. I will definitely see myself staying here when I'm back in San Francisco !!!

ReviewText:The staff was very friendly and attentive. Nice looking hotel (lobby, bar, restaurant, etc...) The room was clean. Housekeeping could have been more on top of restocking toiletries in the room, but well kept otherwise. Great location. Two blocks from the center of Union Square. Bus stops, Street cars, Cable cars pretty close to go wherever you want to around the city.

ReviewText:My wife and I went to SanFran to celebrate our 10th anniversary...I've been in SF a couple of times before but she had never...our stay at the Adagio was great...the staff was really helpful upon arrival...they suggested things to do, told us about the many events going on that weekend, etc. Our room was really nice, on the 8th floor...clean, nice decor, simply great! Great location...2-3 blocks from Union Square, 5 blocks from the train that takes you in/out of the airport...the last night we had drinks and dinner at The Mortimer (Adagio's bar) and it was great: good selection of beers and cocktails, good food...and the music!!! 80-90s hit after hit!!!
