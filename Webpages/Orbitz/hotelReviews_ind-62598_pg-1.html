ReviewText:My BF and I decided to stay at this hotel on our trip to SD. We liked the room and the hotel. Overall, the location was great. We like how close it was to many of the sights we wanted to see. There are also many great restaurants within walking distance.

ReviewText:One block to trolley and many restaurants and Petco Park -newline- Very nice rooms and good service. Restaurant and Bar -newline- a liitle pricey. Self park across street for $15 perday -newline- compared to valet at hotel for $38. Lighting in room makes -newline- reading difficult.

ReviewText:The staff here are very nice and helpful. However, for the price, I was hoping that at least a few things (parking, breakfast) would be complimentary. They sure aren't! Parking cost $38/day, and the restaurant is very pricy as well. We enjoyed our stay overall (the pool and jacuzzi were fantastic), but I think we won't stay in such a loud location next time. Gaslamp district is LOUD!

ReviewText:Everything was perfect specially the location. The only thing was that on their wifi agreement they say if you sign up for royalty plan the wifi would be free. The hotel then charged me $10 for wifi but they later reimbursed me because their website doesn't explain it clearly that you should've also booked your stay directly through the hotel to take advantage of the offer. It was a little bit of an inconvenience at check out time to resolve the issue but staff were great.

ReviewText:This is my second time staying at a Omni Hotel. They continue to impress. The restaurant inside the hotel had pretty good food. Only issue was parking, which was a whopping $38 per day. Other than that there is nothing really to complain about. It's a great hotel and I would definitely stay again.

ReviewText:We loved our stay at the Omni San Diego. The hotel is clean, modern and very impressive in every way. We have stayed at the Solamar and Hard Rock hotel near by and the Omni has exceeded our expectation. The room is very comfortable and clean. The location is within walking distance to many great restaurants. We mentioned we were in San Diego to celebrate our anniversary and they upgraded our room to bay view. And as an added bonus, they sent up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a personalized note to help celebrate the occasion. Thank you Omni for a great stay! We will be back.

ReviewText:My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience at the Omni!!! -newline-  -newline- The staff, unfortunately, told us we could enter Petco Park 2 hours before the game via the skybridge, which was incorrect. -newline-  -newline- The dumb dumb "elite" security made everyone wait until 1.5 hours before game and would not let us in. The "elite" staff and the ticket-takers were just standing on the stadium side of the gate talking to each other. -newline-  -newline- It was extremely disappointing because it was the second Beerfest and we were 30 min late because of this. On the bright side, we ended up not spending an extra $20 on beer because of having to wait... Hmm, I wonder if the Padres ownership would approve of this practice??!

ReviewText:Stayed three nights for a nearby conference. Very good, not spectacular, four star hotel. Be aware that the Padre games can be loud on the Petco Park side.
