ReviewText:Arrived around 10pm, check in was short, sweet, no probs. Room was clean but really small. However, proximity to downtown, the beach(2 blocks), childrens pool, and la jolla shores, made this place great. Staff was courteous, breakfast was ok. In-room coffee maker, fridge and microwave were all adequate.

ReviewText:Overall GREAT experience....the rooms are a little dated, but VERY clean and well kept. The front desk was VERY helpful with all our needs. Parking was a little tight, but FREE as was the Wi Fi. Short walk (acout 400 yds) to the surfers beach. Bed was super comfortable for a hotel...an overall great value for the money, especially considering it's in La Jolla.

ReviewText:The location was perfect. One block from the beach and within walking distance to Prospect Street. The staff was very friendly. The room was a little smelly and didn't seem very clean. But if you plan to stay there, you probably will end up spending most of your time outside of the hotel room.

ReviewText:Our king size non smoking room reservation for not available, was given to someone else. But we were given a 2 separate bed non smoking room which was quite big and reasonably clean. The walls are thin though. It is located very near to the beach. -newline-  -newline- If you are looking for a slightly cheaper hotel which is safe and stay able and in a good location ,consider this one.

ReviewText:we loved staying here because we could walk to wind and sea and LaJolla and even though it is a busy street it was quiet at night. Great staff, helpful and friendly. Will definitely try to get rooms here in future visits.

ReviewText:Speedy check-in, excellent location and very friendly manager. Will definitely return as I travel to La Jolla frequently, you get what you pay for, but for around $90 per night, excellent value. I've seen much shabbier places for that price! -newline- Free internet too!
