ReviewText:The parking charge is high $37 per day and $47 per day valet.We had a lot of problems entering and leaving the car park because the cards we were given did not work. -newline- very expensive for an airport hotel but the view of Boston from the hotel is the best.

ReviewText:Stayed here 5 nights with a friend for a short getaway. Embrace the location across the harbor from central Boston, because it yields lovely views and among the friendliest and most helpful staff I've ever encountered. Does not have every amenity, but is very comfortable. The location is handy for the airport and soundproofing makes it very quiet. There is a frequent free shuttle to the Blue Line and airport.

ReviewText:My wife and I stayed here for one night during a date night visit to Boston. We enjoyed our visit very much and we will likely stay there again. A few observations: -newline-  -newline- 1) The hotel has a terrific view if you reserve one of the harbor view rooms. You can see Boston Harbor, the downtown skyline and even bunker hill. It might even be better than the hotels in the waterfront, as those show you the harbor, but not the skyline. -newline-  -newline- 2) If you're coming by land, it is a bit hard to get to. Parking is expensive and it takes a while to get there by public transportation. If you arrive at the airport it is a snap though. If you don't get seasick, a very fun option is to take the water taxi, which picks up at several places downtown and ferries you across the harbor to the hotel - $17 pp round trip. -newline-  -newline- 3) The rooms are nice, clean and modern. They are not terribly spacious, but bigger than you might expect from an airport Hyatt. -newline-  -newline- 4) Because of the location, this hotel can be much cheaper (up to $100 less) than comparable hotels on the waterfront. A big plus. -newline-  -newline- 5) The staff were friendly and helpful, though obviously this will depend on who is working at any given moment. -newline-  -newline- 6) We didn't have a problem with noise, but since it is so close to the airport, that could be an issue for some travelers.

ReviewText:First I would like to say that EVERYONE was friendly and helpful! Stayed here for first time before an early flight the next morning. -newline- What I found the biggest problem is the age of the furniture, everywhere. In the room everything was scuffed. The leather ottomans were very tired as well as several marks on the black furniture in the room. -newline- The lounge downstairs even had the same problem. The Hi-backed chairs were also tired and worn as well as a large table there. Doesn't management notice this?

ReviewText:The hotel is beautiful. The location is ideal. The staff is friendly and helpful. The free shuttle service to the airport and to the subway station is a great perk. My only complaint is that the nickel and dime you on things like internet, breakfast buffets, and waters. The positives far outweigh the negatives here though and I would highly recommend a night here.
