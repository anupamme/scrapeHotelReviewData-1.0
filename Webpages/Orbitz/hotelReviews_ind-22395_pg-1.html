ReviewText:We chose the Edgewater Hotel for a post-cruise stay, and the location was right next to the pier! This hotel is totally awesome…it was like being at a mountain resort. Loved the spacious well appointed water view room with the fireplace…totally comfortable and charming decor! Bathroom was roomy with a great claw foot tub. The restaurant in the hotel was excellent! We had breakfast there 3 times and loved the food and service. Best gift shop we've ever seen in any hotel lobby! The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of Seattle sites like Pikes Market, the Space Needle, and downtown shopping area. The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful. Overall…our stay at the Edgewater was pretty much perfection!

ReviewText:A very fun experience--never stayed at a hotel before that was built on a pier. It's almost like waking up on a cruise ship. The best parts of Seattle are within walking distance. The lounge and restaurant are beautiful rooms, situated right on the water. Very pleasant.!

ReviewText:I was in twin for the rock n roll race and this hotel was in the perfect location for walking to the start and back from the finish. It's also very close to shopping, pike place market and the space needle. They even gave me a 2pm check out at no charge and stored my bags till 8:30 pm! Over all great experience and would def stay here again.

ReviewText:We stay here all the time when coming to Seattle. It is located in the heart of the action and is always welcoming and accommodating. The rooms are comfortable with some having a balcony on the waterfront. There is a gift shop that makes espresso and other specialty coffees. The lounge and restaurant have excellent food and wonderful wines to choose from.

ReviewText:The location and decor of this hotel are so warm and inventive! Lodge meets industrial. The food was wonderful, from breakfast to dinner. Front desk staff pays attention to detail and tries their best to keep u comfortable. Don't think I would change a thing about this hotel.
