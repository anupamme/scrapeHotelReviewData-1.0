ReviewText:Not only is the Westin Copley ideally located, they work hard to make sure that they have the best front desk staff. It's a treat to check in to a hotel where the staff clearly loves their jobs.

ReviewText:The Copley Westin has a fantastic location just one block from the Old South Boston Church. Many beautiful churches are in the area for sightseeing. There are also tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The beds are so soft and comfortable and the staff provides excellent service.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location for exploring Boston and is attached to a fantastic shopping mall. Rooms are a good size and beds very comfortable. Any staff that we dealt with we're exceptionally helpful, professional and courteous. We didn't use the restaurant as there are great cafes and restaurants close by. There only downside is that there is no free wifi.

ReviewText:I ordered a river view room, and its on floor 33, which comes with a great view. There isn't too much outstanding difference between other hotels other than it's location which is close to everything. But it absolutely worth it's price.
