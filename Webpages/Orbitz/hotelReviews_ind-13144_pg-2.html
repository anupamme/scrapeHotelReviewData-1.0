ReviewText:Sheraton West End is conveniently located near a large shopping mall so we were able to escape from the weather when needed. Gift shop inside is very expensive but has all the necessities including snacks and toiletries. The concierge on check-in was not particularly pleasant or helpful, but most of the staff were friendly. We wanted to leave our bags for a few hours on day of check-out but waited 15 minutes at the bell captain's desk and no one ever showed up. There were a lot of people waiting, so we ended up carrying our bags around town. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable with a nice view of the city. The bed was comfortable and sheets were crisp and clean.

ReviewText:The room was nice but our parking was not validated. Complimentary breakfast was a good perk for the club level rooms.

ReviewText:Stayed with my daughter. Connects to the mall at the Pru, so 70 shops/food at your reach off the second floor. Breakfast at hotel is overpriced, but typical for the city. Restaurant in hotel closes early, so connected to mall is a welcome addition, great place to stay for the money!
