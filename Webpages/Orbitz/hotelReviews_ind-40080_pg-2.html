ReviewText:I spent 2 nights with my wife at this place. I am 35 and she is 34. The 1st issue we had was that the hotel lobby was a nightclub full of an odd-looking group of party-goers. I could barely hear the front desk clerk as we spoke face-to-face about my reservation. The bass from the techno music rocked the lobby. The hotel room I paid for wasn't what I was given. I paid for an upgraded room on a high floor with a view of the bay. It was dark outside when we arrived and we didnt notice that our view was the opposite direction of the bay. The next day we had to pack and move to the room we originally paid for. The 2nd night was awful. Somebody was throwing a birthday party in the room next to us and we heard over 20 drunk party-goers shouting, fighting, and screaming. Somebody from the front desk called our room at 3am saying there was a female in the lobby who wanted access to my room. This was NOT COOL. My wife was laying right next to me. I called the front desk to complain but the noise continued until 4am. My wife and I never slept. Upon check-out, they added a $30 mud mask charge to our bill. We never used any of the obnoxiously-priced bathroom toiletries. I complained to the manager, Jose, but all he offered me was a refund for my valet parking. I will never stay at the "W Hotel" ever again and I will go out of my way to steer any customers from that place.

ReviewText:Wow, hard to classify this place. I'd like to think I'm fairly hip taking my girlfriend out on the town. There is a fine line though between garish, cheap and cutting edge. I think the look of the place is minimalist with cheap accents bordering on run down. With white walls it's easy to show dirt, the upgraded room certainly could have used some better cleaning of the walls. Overdone perfume in the elevator, no doorman at 5:00 when we checked in. Parking is super easy at $30 a night just around the corner on 3rd st. Couldn't find a valet out front anyway. The workout and pool area are fantastic. Lots of people hanging out at night for the brutally expensive drinks but the layout does not lend itself to dancing. There are many clubs an easy walk down the way. Clean confortable bedding and I liked the location with a short walk to Union Square. Amber is a great Indian restaurant nearby. Used the hotel Acura service for the free drive to Beach Blanket Babylon which was as good as it gets. A $15 taxi ride with tip back to the hotel. I'd look for another hotel in the area for next time. Not worth the money.

ReviewText:The W, though pricey, was absolutely fantastic. Our service was top-notch, our linens clean, and our view spectacular. Had the XYZ bar not been under construction, this hotel would be complete.

ReviewText:I was impressed by the tranquil ambiance from the time we entered the front lobby and met sum pleasant curteous staff.  I don't recall seeing any other staff during our 3day stsy (not even any housekeeping staff in the hallways any of the times we did walk to and from our suite.  The elevators and hallways were dimly lit; each elevator was lit different colors.  We entered our suite and we were both happy with the furniture, decor, and how comfotable we were from the start. We had a view of part of this interesting building which called us outdoors to see more of the magnificence from different levels alllowing us to also view some of the city that we would later see on street level.  Before returning to our suite we passed through an outdoor area decorated with linen(?) tent-like shelter if U choose.  This led us to another of my favorite things about The W;  The pool area was empty (I don't know why). -newline- I ended up spending much of my time here.  I enjoyed the comfortable yet sturdy furniture, I swam in the warm, clean pool, and relaxed in the hot tub as well. The cozy atmosphere was also due to the plants and foliage making the atmosphere feel like a tropical paradise.  There was also a stereo system that completed it for me.  I enjoyed the choice of music, volume, and as much time as I did spend out there, I still wondered why wasn't any hotel staff seen anywhere? I ended spending a good amount of time in this pool area by myself which was exactly what I needed. -newline- One of the evenings during our stay we went downstairs for a couple drinks and maybe some apetizers.  I think the watering hole was called the Y or XYZ(?)  It may not even be part of the W.  It felt so different as we entered into an overly crowded and pretentious bar (I guess) that we chose not to stay after waiting too long for our drinks that were served by one employee who seemed to lack tact and charm.  It may have been the wrong day, time, or something else.  Whatever the case was the few other employees seemed to not want to be there either or maybe they just wanted not to have sob many people to serve.

ReviewText:I stayed at the hotel during a meeting at the Mascone Center in San Francisco. It is located right across the street from the convention center and convient to most destinations in the fincial district. My problem with the hotel is that once you get past the "Vibe" you have an expensive hotel that nickels and dimes you for everything. WiFi and coffee cost extra, ShoTime was a movieless version? I have stayed at the W in Dallas and Chicago as well. I like the edgy atmosphere and I have no problem paying for that but WiFi in 2011? C'mon...

ReviewText:Staff very responsive, helpful. "Whatever, whenever" is great program. Location was the best for our conference and sight-seeing. Terrific view! Love the modern, playful feel - and the bar makes a mean Lemon Drop.
