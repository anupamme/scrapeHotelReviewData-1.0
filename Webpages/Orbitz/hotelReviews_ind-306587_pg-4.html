ReviewText:The room was tiny and not clean. The a.c did not work well and there were no other rooms to switch to. Our next door neighbor was loud 2 of our 3 nights. Screaming and rearranging furniture. I called front desk but did not help. They went out and came back at 2 am and the fun started again. They did not offer anything for a discount at our checkout knowing that we had 2 nights of no sleep. The sheets were itchy and yhere were never enough towels in the room. There was hair and food on the floor.

ReviewText:In the Gaslamp District near Petco Park lies this steal of a deal for a hotel. You will not be able to get more bang for your buck anywhere else in the area.

ReviewText:Nice rooms, clean. No refrigerator unless you pay extra. Ice machines are only on every other floor. No smoking policy yet we smelled pot on the 4th floor when we went to pick up ice.

ReviewText:I stayed here to participate in an event at the San Diego convention center. It was an easy six block walk through the senic Gas Lamp district. The hotel staff were all very personable and knowledgable. Free Wi-FI throughout the hotel, business center and restuarant were all appreciated.

ReviewText:Every day there were noise and dust early in the morning due to renovation going on in the building. The noise disturbed us and dust through the vents annoyed us and caused sore throats and headaches. -newline- We were asked to re-use towels and linen the next day. -newline- We were not aware of the $38.00 per night for valet parking.
