ReviewText:Hotel location was perfect. Just 20 minute bile ride to center of Boston. Rooms were clean and spacious. The only thing was service was horrible. It was so difficult to get anyone on the phone. Called room service no answer. Front desk no answer. Called several times different dates. And the hotel charged 38 dollars a night for parking. Ridiculous.

ReviewText:The only issue is for fees, which aren't taken into consideration. For example, I think parking was $30-40 per night. Other than that, great place with a great location

ReviewText:The hotel only has two restaurants. Both were, at least, one day closed only for private event during my visit there. -newline- The first day I tried to request a room service meal it was not a menu; so, I had to phoned twice to obtain one. -newline- Finally, one day, exiting the bathroom I had on my window two men cleaning it. It could be my wife exiting nude the bathroom. Those men were doing noise there by two days, impending me to study in my room. The objective of this travel was to attend a course there.

ReviewText:The view was absolutely beautiful. You could see the entire city of Boston. The location was ideal being just a short walk to the city, or a very inexpensive cab drive. There were also beautiful sites to see and things to do in Cambridge as well. Ideal location, highly recommended.
