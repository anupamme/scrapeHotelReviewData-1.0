ReviewText:Paid extra for the bayview room with a balcony but when I got there the told me they didn't have any balcony rooms available. The desk clerk told that someone had "decided to stay an extra day" and they couldn't move them out. They did not offer any kind of compensation for the trouble. That was disappointing, but the rooms were nice and the morning free breakfast was good.

ReviewText:Location... location... location... it's not just for the purchase of a home but also for vacation stays. Embassy is located next to public transportation (lightrail & buses) as well as walking distance to many vacation sites. My wife and I enjoyed the inclusive happy hour and our children enjoyed creating their own breakfast at the made-to-order omelet bar (also inclusive). My son had many place to ride his skateboard which made him not want to leave. Great place... great time!

ReviewText:The last thing that can be experienced on vacation are bad surprises. I expected a good hotel and that's what we got. -newline- If you have a car, parking could be an inconvienience

ReviewText:Our only issue was that checkin was at 4:00 pm.. We got there after 5.. We were checked in to our room and when we get to our room the door is open and the cleaning lady was still cleaning. It wasn't her fault and she was confused at how we were checked in when she hadn't released the room as being ready yet. So that was a little awkward being in the room while she finished her cleaning. Other than that it was great.. And the complimentary buffet was great too! -newline-  -newline- It's a little far for walking to Gas Lamp.. Especially in heels. Will most likely pick another hotel if were going there for that reason. Will pick this hotel if we do the theme park experience.

ReviewText:My wife and I have been coming to this hotel every August for seven or eight years for an annual convention, and every year we we grow increasingly frustrated by the management's predatory attitude toward their customers. Reservations are non-refundable. Everything is an expensive add-on: overnight parking, internet access, it all costs extra. Services are poor: we had to stand in line 25 to 30 minutes for the breakfast., and several items had run out when we got to the serving area. Several years ago the excellent in-house restaurant closed; it has yet to reopen. This year, the hotel refused to give us Hilton Honors points because we made the reservation through Orbitz rather than their own web site--regardless of the fact that the Embassy's web site said there were no rooms available but Orbitz offered several rooms at a variety of prices. We're done with Embassy--we'll pick a different hotel next year.
