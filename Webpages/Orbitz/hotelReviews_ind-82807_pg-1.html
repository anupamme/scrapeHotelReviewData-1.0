ReviewText:The staff were a bit off the mark. For example they forgot to make a dinner reservation as requested

ReviewText:The room was really nice & clean! We got there at around noon, hoping to get into our room a bit early, but had to wait till 3pm - not their fault but would have nice if they had accommodated us. Parking was ridiculously expensive at the hotel & around - we spent as much in parking as the rental! Lots if public transportation options close by.

ReviewText:We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Zetta. It is a quiet and comfortable small hotel directly adjacent to the Westfield San Francisco Centre. It’s a nice 7 minute walk (0.3 miles) from Union Square and all the downtown activity. The street the hotel is on, 5th Street, is not a particularly fancy street so there isn’t much of a view to be had other than a building and liquor store across the street. There are 116 rooms and the property is still very new and clean since opening a little over a year ago (the result of the renovation of an older hotel). We had a room with two queen beds on the 5th floor, which was 415 square feet – a nice size compared to many other rooms in San Francisco (though the single bed rooms are smaller). The gym is located on the 4th floor and has pretty new, hi-tech equipment. You need your room key to access it. Free, new earbuds are provided to those who want to use them while working out. The valet service is convenient, though be aware that everything is taxed and what is advertised as a $50.00 a day parking fee is actually $57.00 per day due to a parking tax. The décor is modern-tech and quirky. This is definitely geared more toward a younger, hip crowd. The bathroom amenities are large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel; nothing you can take home :( I have stayed at other 4-5 star hotels in the area that I liked better and were less expensive, but we had a good stay here and if the price were right, we would stay again. The Powell & Market Cable Car Turnaround is right around the corner, but be prepared for a long wait to get on here if you wish to ride. The line was very long every time we passed by. Also, the hotel does a pre-authorization to your credit card upon check-in, which I was not informed about so it caused some confusion once we got home and I saw a $200.00 charge pending from Hotel Zetta.

ReviewText:Perfect location, great bar and service. The hot water went out unfortunately the next morning so showering wasn't an option.

ReviewText:Staff were very helpful and friendly, we liked the added games room. Only downside i would say was the fancy coffee maker, as you only got two pods per day, and there was no kettle, apart from that we couldn't really fault it.

ReviewText:my husband and i flew up for a short weekend getaway for two nights. -newline- the staff were all really helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived. and its very centrally located - so you can easily head to the mission or union square, the ferry building, the fillmore, etc. -newline-  -newline- we also had dinner one evening at the Cavalier (the hotel restaurant) and it was actually great. we are always a little skeptical of hotel restaurants :) -newline-  -newline- overall the kor hotel group did it again. the design is clean and modern but has character and was honestly one of the only hotels we thought were done well when trying to decide where to stay.
