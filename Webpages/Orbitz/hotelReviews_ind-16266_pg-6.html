ReviewText:We live in San Francisco but wanted to experience being tourists! The location is convenient to MUNI, BART and Cable cars! The ground transportation took us over the city but the shops are just a few steps away! The indoor pool was awesome with the shallow end being only 2.5 feet! Great for my little ones!

ReviewText:Great location. Walking distance to many sites and transportation access. Only complaint is that in the standard room, they offer a "petite queen." It is so small, it's actually a full size. Very small. Was very disappointed that such a prestigious and highly rated hotel had such a small and uncomfortable bed. Have been wanting to stay here for many years that we've been visiting San Francisco. Was truly disappointed with the bed. The hotel tries to offer an upgrade that comes with a King size bed. Seemed like they wanted to "nickel & dime" us with that offer. They should just get rid of those beds.

ReviewText:I used the hotel for a conference which was being held there. I upgraded to a 2-bedroom when my friend decided to attend the conference with me. The first night (Friday) was fine; however, housekeeping came when my friend was taking a nap at about 2:30 PM, so she told them to come back later. She left the room at 3:00 PM, but housekeeping never did come back and the room never got cleaned.

ReviewText:View from the windows in the pictures is not actual view. I was hoping to see expansive SF views. Amenities are good. Water pressure is awesome. Great attention to detail inside the room.

ReviewText:There was a starbucks in the lobby! The hotel was great, location cannot get any better, everything was either walkable distance or nearby. Staff was super helpful and nice, hotel was modern and looked great. Only complaint, have to pay for wifi and to use any extra amenities like gym or pool.

ReviewText:The check in process was slow. Every thing else was outstanding. The concierge service was so helpful. Theresa helped us with directions on the cable car vs street car transportation and tickets to Alcatraz. She was so pleasant and friendly.

ReviewText:The Nikko is a lovely hotel. -newline- The flowers are memorable in that their placement and colors were well-selected. -newline- The bed was too soft and the pillows too hard, in my opinion. -newline- The concierge, Ernesto, is all one could hope for ! -newline- I went to see the David Hockney Exhibit. -newline- I shopped a bit at Gumps, I visited and dined with a friend in Piedmont, and I went to Tartine Bakery, which was so crowded, and I understand why! -newline- I would consider The Nikko again. The other hotels I have stayed are The Stanford Court and The St. Francis hotels. -newline- I'm sorry I didn't stay another 3 days to, at least, enjoy the Fienstein Bar and more museums and shopping. -newline- It's a lovely city. -newline- The Tenderloin area serves as a reminder that all Americans need to address poverty.
