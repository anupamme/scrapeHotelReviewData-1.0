ReviewText:We were in this hotel from Dec 25 -31, 2013. It was great location and good hotel. Only complain is that I can not find anything in the room that stating they would charge the bottle water on the desk, not in the small frig. We used two of them, that cost us ~$20 at check out. That is little too deceptive and too much of a charge!
