ReviewText:We were in town for the Bowl game and only needed the room for one night. Easy taxi ride to and from the game. -newline- Room was bigger than expected. Only problem was it was noisy being close to the elevator. No hairdryer in the room, but front desk promptly brought one. -newline- Happy hour downstairs was a good way to enjoy a drink and snack.

ReviewText:The decor is chic. The room was clean, but the bed was suitable only for people who like the super-pillowtop type mattresses, and not someone who likes a firmer mattress. -newline-  -newline- The breakfast menu was limited and overpriced. And the burger and fries were overseasoned. -newline-  -newline- Overall, though, the room was pleasant and the hotel was well run.

ReviewText:As soon as we walked into the hotel, we were warmly greeted by all the staff. I was excited because the hotel had a very modern and vibrant feel to it. -newline-  -newline- The room was nothing short of that either. It was extremely comfortable and I had a great view of SF from the 14th floor. -newline-  -newline- The best thing about the hotel is that it is central to everything. It's almost right in the heart of Union Square so everything was accessible. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay here again!
