ReviewText:This was one of the most exciting places to stay, right -newline- next to Faneuil Hall. Great views from the Hotels and -newline- we loved the balcony. No need for car everything is walking distance and the subway and trains are reasonably priced.

ReviewText:Great location, extremely friendly staff. Food was very good, but a bit expensive ($5 for coffee in the restaurant). I'd also suggest that WiFi should be free in the rooms. Still, the location, cleanliness, and friendliness of staff helped make this a great trip. Being on Boston's Freedom trail also helped!

ReviewText:Friendliness and helpfulness from the valet to the cleaning staff! Service is great! But most if all the location was perfect! Close to the water, aquarium, right on Faneuil hall, bars, and restaurants. Always a cab waiting if you need. The price was best in town and you won't be disappointed.

ReviewText:The hotel is located right in the middle of the Freedom Trial, which was perfect for us. Most tours covering the first half of the trail ended right across the street from our hotel. We would then be able to do the second half on our own just by stepping out the door the next day. Lots of restaurants and shops were located nearby, and the subway station was located only a short distance away. The hotel was very clean and the staff was super friendly and able to help us find whatever we were looking for in the area. However, wi-fi was available on a pay for use basis. Most good hotels include it for free.
