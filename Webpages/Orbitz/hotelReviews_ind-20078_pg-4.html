ReviewText:This boutique hotel was absolutely perfect, there is some superb character to this hotel, situated right in the heart of the gaslamp quarter and within walking distance ot the convention centre and the famouns San Diego Pier, The staff were very friendly and informative and the twists and turns in the corridors added to the ambience. -newline- I would most definately be back to visit.

ReviewText:Wonderfully quaint room, felt like a B & B. Unfortunately, nothing in the Gaslamp Area of San Diego opens until 10:00 am, so don't expect an early breakfast. -newline- The staff was beyond wonderful, allowing me out the back door for a cigarette at 2:00 am, since I was still on EDT. I would stay there in a heartbeat if I had occasion to go to San Diego again.

ReviewText:This was a nice little adventure. The hotel is full of history and a little creaky but very clean. The location is right off the Gaslamp which was perfect for getting around downtown. We recommend it!

ReviewText:We stayed at the Horton Grand Hotel while attending a conference at the San Diego Conference Center. The location was perfect. We walked to the conference center each day. Our room was very spacious with a balcony that overlooked the courtyard, and we enjoyed the city lights in the distance. The staff was exceptional. Ken, Paula, and Greg were warm and friendly and recommended excellent places to eat. We had such a great time and would recommend the Horton Grand Hotel to everyone.

ReviewText:Wonderful stay at this totally modern yet historic hotel. The beds could not have been better. The room was perfectly clean and stayed that way throughout our stay thanks to the maid service. The hotel itself is filled with thoughtful touches that go above and beyond. An example is that the elevator passes little mini "rooms," set pieces of historic rooms with antiques. Something to look at during the ride! -newline- The only sour note was the valet runners. They absolutely could not get it together!! One day they took over 40 minutes to bring our car. Others got immediate service. On checkout they brought the wrong car then insisted we should "wait our turn" for them to try again. No tip, no love! -newline- Overall, a great little hotel within walking distance of the whole Gaslight district. Suggest 222 for breakfast (one block to left) but be prepared to wait in line on a weekend.

ReviewText:All of the negative review issues that I read no longer existed during my stay. For example, the internet connection was great, and there was a big modern tv. -newline-  -newline- Stuff that was missing: I was told that the room would have a mini fridge and microwave. It had neither. I did not complain, and if I had I may have been moved to a room that had these things, but I did not complain because the room was quiet, and I didn't want to get moved to a noisy location. There was a plethora of restaurants in the area, and I didn't spend much time in the room anyway. -newline-  -newline- I was also supposed to get 2 bottles of water every day, but only got 2 the entire 5-day stay. I drank tap - it wasn't too bad.
