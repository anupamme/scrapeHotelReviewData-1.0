ReviewText:Very arty. I liked the decor and records. Tiny room for this price without a bathtub. Internet costs extra.

ReviewText:Location...Location...Location. The location is outstanding as you can take the light rail to 6th and Pine for less than $3 per person. from Seatac. Hotel Max is located within walking distance of most all major sightseeing items. I used Lyft for the 1st time and it was really cool to Kerry Park for $8. -newline-  -newline- The staff are extremely helpful , professional, and very kind. I was able to get a cot ahead of time for free from the manager for my 11 y/o son. The rooms were very clean but some might be a tad small. But honestly you are supposed to sleep in it and tour most of the day. The have a trendy bar with awesome beer made locally. -newline-  -newline- We got free wi-fi but .44 Mbps is kinda slow in Seattle (fiber)but I am spoiled at 100M U/D with fiber to the home in Korea. The elevators are small and can be a little noisy if you have an adjacent room. -newline-  -newline- I was able to book the room at an outstanding rate and the value for the room and all the benefits are impossible to match. I would advice you to stay here if you are interested in value/cost. -newline-  -newline- It is not theTaj Mahal by any means but it is a cool, trendy, hip style hotel that is an awesome ROI on your dollar.

You really only need.to be there to sleep.and.shower, there is.too much to.do.in the.city to.spend it I. A.room all day. The staff was so nice.and knowledgeable about fhe city. We did.not.have one dull.moment. We were able to.walk everywhere. We.would stay here again in a heartbeat!!! -newline-  -newline- Heather and Katie

ReviewText:This is our 4th or 5th stay at Hotel Max and we always enjoy it. If we arrive early, they will try to get us into a room right away. The first room smelled a little funny to my nose (my boyfriend didn't notice), so they moved us to a different room and left us a complimentary 20oz beer with an apology note. Very classy. 2nd room was a little noisy and bright--would be fine for people going out until late, but we get to bed pretty early. They moved us without issue and we loved our third room. The beds are comfy; love the pillow menu and bathroom products. I take advantage of the little gym, which is great. It's perfectly located downtown central to everything. The rooms are a little small, but I just think of it as a European style hotel. Clean, modern, efficient--but with cute amenities (free gumballs in the main lobby and beer tasting at 5pm!). The staff is pretty incredible. We will always come here when we visit.

ReviewText:Great location , -newline- friendly , helpful staff -newline- Clean,very clean rooms -newline- Comfortable bed(they even offer pillow menu) -newline- Wonderful food in the downstairs restaurant -newline- Some small spoilers:parking fees are higher then across the street underground garage fees -newline- And it was not fully explained. -newline- No refrigerator in the room -newline- Small bottle of water in the room $ 4.00. -newline- Go figure they pour free beer but charge a lot for water. -newline- Rooms are compact and if a lot of space important for you - you will not be pleased. But I knew about this beforehand and it was ok with us.

ReviewText:My stay at Hotel Max could not have been any more perfect. The entire staff went out of their way to make sure that my husband and I were happy. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and Hotel Max made it very special for us. Everyone from the manager to the housekeepers was warm and friendly and ready to answer any questions that we had about Seattle. -newline-  -newline- The bed and linens were so comfortable and luxurious. The rooms are small but cozy and charming. I love Seattle and will be back. I will stay at Hotel Max again because I don't think anywhere else could compare.

ReviewText:You get what you pay for. It is what it is. My opinion is that anyone giving this property less than 3 stars probably didn't read many reviews and just looked at the price and the hotel-class rating. Come on people, most all major hotels in Downtown Seattle in the Summer are mid $200 up. This place is in the middle of downtown only a couple blocks from dozens of restaurants, two shopping malls, movie theater complex and 6 blocks (10 min or less) to Pike Place Market. YET, it costs about $100 less per night than most of the other chain hotels nearby. The "catch" is that a) the rooms and bathrooms a very small - think Europe style, and there are no amenities like pool, jacuzzi, etc. You can ride the trolley to South Lake Union, the station is only a block away. -newline-  -newline- If you are looking for a Westin/Hyatt/Sheraton/Hilton-esque lodging experience, this hotel is NOT for you. This hotel is a boutique hotel that has a grunge music theme. The doors have photos of famous grunge music figures and the hallways are dark to match the black and white photo motif. -newline-  -newline- Instead of a wine hour in the lobby they have a free micro-brew hour. A nice change. Staff is friendly. If you are a rather large person, the rooms are probably too small for you. I'm normal size male and there is not enough room in the bathroom to towel your body dry without doing it in the bedroom. It didn't bother me though. I'm a local and just needed a place to stay the night after going to a concert at the Paramount theater and for $133/night it served it's purpose well. The mattress was VERY comfortable, firm, but not too firm borderline as good as Westin Heavenly bed. -newline-  -newline- My only complaint is that they only have two old elevators (this hotel is a renovated old building) and only 4 people max can fit in the elevators at a time. Service staff shares the same elevators. So when busy, there can be a significant wait to get an elevator. -newline-  -newline- Bottom line, you get what you pay for. You can't beat the location but the trade off is you get very small rooms/bathrooms and not much as far as hotel amenities. If you're not a fat and just need a place to sleep and shower, this hotel will serve you well and at an excellent price compared to what else is in the area. Manage your expectations and know what you are getting yourself into.
