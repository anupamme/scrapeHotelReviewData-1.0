ReviewText:Staff is ultra - friendly. Expected more from the room we stayed in, but it had a fire pit on the very private balcony on the first floor, which was a nice touch. I'd say the room was more bungalow style and could probably use revamping like their tower rooms but all things considered, we had a nice stay. Very family friendly with water slides. Bike rental included in our stay was a nice treat.

ReviewText:We flew from Vegas to San Diego for ' rehab ' at this hotel as we got married in Vegas . We were on the 14th floor in the tower and to be honest the room was fantastic with stunning views of the ocean . The only set back was we asked for a smoking room and the hotel was strictly no smoking !! A 250 dollar was imposed if you got caught !! The downside to the resort is you have to go outside for entertainment , think the hotel is geared up for business conferences mostly . Taxi fares return to gas lamp quarters are approx 50-60 dollars inc of tip !! BUT just outside the hotel is a bus stop and for 2.50 you take a 10 min ride to old town where you go to the train start ion and buy a 'compass card for 2 dollars and load it up with 5 dollars . This gives you a 24 hr pass for busses and trolleys (trains. ) along any routes so now you can get about for 5 dollars per day a huge saving on taxis !! And believe it or not it's just as quick if you get your timing right . Gas lamp quarter is great and we had a great time in Diego ! What the hotel doesn't tell you is that there is a. 20 dollar resort fee per room per day , for this you get internet , the use of a small gym. , cycle hire 2 bottles of water per day and 2 coffees and 1 cup of tea to share in your room ! If you hire a car they charge 30 dollars a night to park !!! Check out yor bill at the end of your stay as I got charged 58 dollars car parking and I didn't even have a car !!! This was sorted out without a fuss . Overall hotel great but really lacks entertainment

ReviewText:Everything was great at this hotel. The only thing that was a little bit of a surprise was the $29/night self parking rate, so add in also the $19/night resort fee and you need to budget about an extra $50/ night. However, these prices were cheaper than our friends fees who stayed at a nearby resort... So I am not complaining about the price just letting you know to be prepared for it. Can't wait to come back soon with our kids!!

ReviewText:My daughter held her wedding ceremony and reception at this location. The staff was superb in every respect, as was the food and all aspects of their service. -newline- The physical plant on the other hand showed many signs of neglect and disrepair: ie. many sections of the concrete walkways have shifted height and present many trip hazards. The walkway from the Red Marlin restaurant has many rotting members on the railing running from the building to the shore. Overall the lansdcaping around plants and trees looked deficient.

ReviewText:We were very pleased with the hotel as it was better than we expected. The view from our balcony on the top floor was fantastic. All the staff were courteous and went all the way to help us. We will have very fond memories of San Diego.

ReviewText:Close to everything. Comfortable and clean room. We hardly used the rental car but still used it. Needed brighter lights in bathroom and faster internet connection.
