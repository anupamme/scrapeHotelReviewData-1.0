ReviewText:My husband and I were coming to stay after a Giants game which we have done before. Before the game we walked to shopping which was very convenient. We walked from the hotel to dinner and then to the ballgame and back. The staff was very friendly and check in was easy. The atmosphere and decor of the hotel is fabulous.

ReviewText:Did a weekend in San Francisco with my mom. The Palace is in a perfect location right on Market Street which is a nice through-line for the city. The room was comfortable with 2 doublebeds and plenty of space so as not to feel cramped. The exercise and pool facilities are a highlight as was the beautiful decor and dining room. -newline-  -newline- Overall, the hotel is pricey, but I was lucky to get a deal online ($143/night). If you can find a rate within your price range, would definitely recommend staying at the Palace.

ReviewText:We are Bay Area locals and stayed just for a quick weekend getaway to be prepared for an early morning in the city. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and convenient-- just what we needed. We used the BART system to ride into the city, and the hotel is located mere steps away from the Montgomery Street BART entrance, making the trip very easy. Check in was a breeze, and our room was well appointed with luxury bath products, complimentary bottled waters, and a comfy bed. My boyfriend struggles with chronic back pain and has a hard time sleeping because of it, but he slept like a rock on their mattress! It was wonderful! -newline-  -newline- We were disappointed not to be able to have time to take a dip in the beautiful pool, but managed to have a drink at the Palace's Pied Piper bar and loved the old photographs showing the hotels historic past and famous visitors! -newline-  -newline- Over all we had a wonderful stay.

ReviewText:We spent a wonderful 4 days at the Palace. I can't remember staff who were more friendly and helpful in a long time. All the rooms, private and public are gorgeous. The pool was wonderful and most of the time we had it to ourselves. My only critique would be that WiFi/internet should be included in the rooms. It's 25.- daily in the rooms, but free in the lobby.
