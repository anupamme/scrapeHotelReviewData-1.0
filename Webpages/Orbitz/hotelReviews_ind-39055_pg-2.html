ReviewText:The staff at Mark Hopkins was extremely friendly, helpful and professional. The valets greeted myself and my friend in the parking lot immediately, the bell hop safely stored our luggage after checkout (we were in a class all day) people at the front desk were helpful, housekeepers always had a smile and acknowledged us each and every time we saw them in the hall. The food was good also. I don't have any complaints at all and I would highly recommend this place.

ReviewText:The Mark Hopkins is a San Francisco classic, on Nob Hill, with a great view, very elegant. Our only complaint was that we left shoes to be shined overnight and they rang our doorbell, twice, at 7:00AM rather than just leaving them, as they said they would do.

ReviewText:Let me start by saying that I've NEVER written a bad review in all my years of traveling the world - including my job producing and directing for The Travel Channel & Discovery. The Intercontinental Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco left me stranded at the waterfront wharf at 11pm at night when I told them I was alone and afraid and needed their help. They refused to call me a cab stating it was against their policy. the hotel refused to call me a cab saying it was against their policy! I told them I was alone at the wharf . The hotel said they couldn't call me a cab but they could give me a number. I said I didn't have a pen to write it down and that it was dark and desolate needed their help and they said, "that's our policy, sorry, call back if you want a cab number" and then hung up on me! I called them back to get number and beg at this point for them to help me by calling a cab for me - a female guest alone and somewhat upset at this point - they rattled off number which I forgot and when I called back - they rattled it off and hung up again.I'm a New Yorker and comfortable in any situation but this was crazy and I want to warn other female guests and have the Intercontinental change their policy. I asked the Fairmont hotel across the street the next day that if a guest called in for a cab from outside location and the concierge was of course they would!

ReviewText:We were pleased with the accommodations and the complimentary access to the Top of the Mark. However, the Christmas display next door at the Fairmount put the Mark Hopkins lobby to shame.

ReviewText:We arrived and the type of room we chose was not available. The front desk person was kind enough to upgrade us to a corner room in the next grade up. Everyone was wonderful. The only drawback I can even mention is that it's 59.00 to park your car. You might want to make other arrangements. :)

ReviewText:When I first saw the mark Hopkins intercontinental hotel I was in awe. The building perched on top of the hill looked executive and posh. The location and the ambience inside was welcoming. I would definitely stay there again. The staff were all polite and respectful. The. Band at the top of the mark was good and I enjoyed my evening up there. The view of san francisco was fantastic.
