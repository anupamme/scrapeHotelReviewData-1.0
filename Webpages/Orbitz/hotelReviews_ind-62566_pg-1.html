ReviewText:Our son's two favorite things are sports and history, so Boston was a great spring break location. The Onyx was the ideal spot for exploring the city. We walked, used the T and even secured a car for our trip back to the airport, and the Onyx staff was helpful in helping us navigate an unfamiliar city. The location was just blocks from the wonderful restaurants on the North End and several local pubs with excellent Clam Chowder. Right across the street from the TD Garden for the Celtics game, but not far from anything, we will definitely stay at the Onyx again.

ReviewText:Took a chance on booking the Onyx and glad we did. Terrific location (around the corner from the subway), can walk to great restaurants. The hotel and staff were wonderful. We didn't figure out how to get internet until the last night's stay, and the wine hour was great. Will definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:Not a ton of amenities, and a somewhat out of the way location, but close to the North Station T stop and from there the rest of Boston. Rooms are pretty small, but not surprising for a downtown hotel. Still had space at reasonable rates less than two weeks before Anime Boston, when many hotels were pushing up their rates, although it isn't particularly close to the Hynes convention center (although it's on the same T line, which is a flat rate regardless of distance traveled).

ReviewText:My husband and I stayed on 7th floor of the Onyx. The rooms was small, well decorated, and very clean. The staff was very friendly and pleasant. We were offered us bottles of water for our long trip home. -newline-  -newline- There was a quaint wine reception from 5-6 pm in the hotel lobby and we attended. It was very welcoming and we enjoyed a couple of glasses of free wine! We also had a snack at the Ruby Room which was very tasty. -newline-  -newline- The best thing about this hotel is it's location. It is one block from TD Garden, an easy walk to Quincy market, Nathanial Hall, the New England Aquarium, and tons of restaurants and shops. -newline-  -newline- Another small treat was delicious orange infused and lemon and lime infused water in the lobby at all times. In addition to that, very decadent hot chocolate, tea, and coffee in the lobby for the first half of the day.

ReviewText:We needed a place to stay while attending a graduation in Cambridge, and though the Onyx is in Boston, we got there quickly by taxi ($20) from the airport, were close to the T's Green Line and steps away from Boston's historic quarters, all around. The staff was very welcoming and friendly, the room was snug but very comfortable and quiet.

ReviewText:ok, i will start off with the good first. The staff, a young bunch of recent college grads for the most part, was extemely nice and helpful. they were great!! -newline-  -newline- ok, now for the not so good....parking is a hassle...i guess that's the norm at city hotels though....not in the greatest area of town....good only if you are an out of town fan that is going to TD Garden. the room is very small, but very clean. they up-charge you for everything.....internet, printing something, parking, etc....a bit annoying to me. -newline-  -newline- I would only recommend staying here if you get a great rate.

ReviewText:Very close to airport and Cambridge. On a back street where there are a few bars ... so request a room in the back. Bathroom needs more hooks for towels once used: there was only one. Nice robes and bath products. Rooms ending in 1 and 2 are very close so ask for something over #5 that is also away from the elevators. Why are doors in hotels never soundproof? We cold hear people in the hall easily but that's probably all hotels. -newline- Great staff!! and Really good organic free coffee in the lobby every morning. The room service food was not good and, as usual, very expensive. Then they add 18% gratuity on that. Luckily there is an Au Bon Pain across the street but only open weekdays.
