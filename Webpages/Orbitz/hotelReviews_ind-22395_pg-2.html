ReviewText:The view is always amazing. Perfect place to stay if you are going to the game. And the small room was inexpensive, especially compared to other downtown hotels.

ReviewText:Our experience is always fabulous at the Edgewater! Our taxi left early and so the Bell captain drove us to our concert! Restaurant staff was very good as was the dinner and Housekeeping staff was friendly and helpful! Its a high-end experience in a casual setting. We make sure we stay at least once a year here for special occasions!

ReviewText:We stayed a weekend and found nothing remarkable about this hotel other than its located on the water. The city view rooms look out onto train tracks -- with freight trains passing in the night and early morning. The rooms are average in comfort, and the bed was soft and uncomfortable. $39 overnight parking in a warehouse district is an insult.

ReviewText:The hotel has a great view and rooms are warm and looks amazing. Also each room has a fire place. The 67 restaurant breakfast is one of the best in Seattle and I would go there again but bring a fishing pole to fish out of the window;)

ReviewText:Relaxing stay after a corporate event. It would have been even better if I could have reached the shower head to adjust it. There is noway I can stay at the hotel without my husband to reach the shower head to adjust it and if the lights on the makeup mirror had worked.
