ReviewText:The hotel is located right around the corner from Union Square, so it is an easy walk to all the great stores and eating venues in the area. The reception / check-in personnel is very attentive. I had an issue with the bathtub being clogged up. I called the front desk and they had somebody fix the problem within 10 minutes.

ReviewText:Stayed here for a few days right before Christmas. Everything was clean but the rooms were a bit out of date.

ReviewText:Perfect location, and great stay as always. We stay here every year for a Union Square shopping trip. -newline-  -newline- This year we booked the deal including valet parking. I pointed this out during check-in. Morning of checkout, noticed a $62 parking charge on the room invoice. They quickly cleared this at the front desk, though they did ask to see my confirmation email on my phone. -newline-  -newline- You'd think 0rbitz & the hotel would have better integration.

ReviewText:Had an amazing time in San Francisco, largely due to our stay at the Grand Hyatt. -newline- The staff is wonderful. From the moment we got the the curb to the moment they booked us a ride to the airport. -newline-  -newline- Definitely the most professional and friendly valet staff I’ve ever come across. Each time you head for the front door they open it. They take great care of your vehicle, the parking garage they use is right across the street, they just have to drive around the block to park. Anything you need they’ll take care of it. -newline- Front desk staff was wonderful. They hooked us up with some cupcakes and other offerings because it was my mother-in-laws birthday. -newline- The concierge were very helpful and even the housekeeping staff seemed energetic. -newline- 4 stars because there was some trash left in the window track behind the curtains, the room was pretty clean, the pillowcases, pillows and beds could use an upgrade already. The mattress was fairly comfy but too soft for a large person and not very supportive. Mattress was also showing the classic “dip” in the middle. -newline- So, the room could’ve been cleaner, the beds should be of better quality, and pillows could use and upgrade, but nothing is perfect. -newline- Staff was excellent, great location basically right on Union Square (around the corner). Stayed in 7 different hotels/B&B's in SF and the Grand Hyatt presented us the best staff, location and service. -newline- Would stay here again for sure

ReviewText:Very nice. The entire hotel has been remodeled. Very centralized to all the shops. Convenient and next to a big parking fir those not wishing to pay their valet parking. I would definitely stay there again.
