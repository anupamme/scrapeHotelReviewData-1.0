ReviewText:The Sheraton Boston is a very comfortable hotel with a wonderful location. We did not need to rent a car, as it was a 5 minute walk to 2 subway stations, and Boston is a great city to walk in. We were a few minutes from Newbury Street and 10-15 minutes from Copley Square. We were able to walk to and from Fenway Park in under 30 minutes, and thus bypassed traffic and crowded subway cars after a Red Sox game. We loved that the hotel is connected to the Prudential Center and its restaurants, food court, and shops. The hotel also has its own Starbucks in the lobby, which was perfect for early morning breakfasts. Our room was very comfortable and clean, and the hotel staff was pleasant. Although a bit pricey, we would choose to stay there again.

ReviewText:A good hotel in an excellent location. Room was on a high floor with good views over the river. Nice friendly staff and free use of computers in the lobby was quite handy. -newline- Would have been better if room had a fridge and a safe but was a good size for the 3 of us.

ReviewText:Excellent hotel, great location, considering is was the busy long (Boston College moving in weekend), hotel was very busy, and check in very long. Elevators are very slow and painful, but hotel is planning upgrade to improve elevator service/time. -newline- Very good.

ReviewText:My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay here immensely. Can't beat the location. Some of the building is a little worn, but well maintained and the service was excellent.

ReviewText:This hotel was very good. We really approved of their green policy and welcomed the rewards facility for guests who did not want their towels replaced every day. However the system was over complicated and meant that nothing in the room was replenished or cleaned. Also it was not made clear how the rewards tokens were issued or how they could be used. This may sound churlish when every thing else was very good.

ReviewText:This hotel located in a PERFECT location of Fenway/Copley/Back Bay of Boston has recently had a facelift and every dollar spent was worth it. We were celebrating an anniversary and the hotel with its fantastic view of the city and close proximity to shopping and restaurants was perfect. We would do it all over again and hope to very soon. We recommend the Sheraton without a doubt.

ReviewText:It was good in the hotel, it's cleaned. The only problem is there is no soap , shampoo and conditioner on the next day? Not only in the second night but on our succeeding nights. We only leave notice don't forget to refill shampoo n conditioner . And also no refill for the taZo tea but its alright . Hoping next time they won't forget those basic needs and hoping they will include toothpaste so that its nir burden for the travelers during check in specially if we only bring one hand carry on baggage that no need to check in but need to inspect what ever liquid we have . And the parking is unbelievable sooo expensive. Thanks you but over all that's was good

ReviewText:Nice place, efficient staff. We were on the 20th floor and the elevators were a running joke amongst all guests. In all seriousness, it was not funny. Elevators were always over filled and guests were stuck waiting as elevator after elevator passed by full. Very frustrating. So much so that we started taking the express to floor 26 and walking stairs down to floor 20.
