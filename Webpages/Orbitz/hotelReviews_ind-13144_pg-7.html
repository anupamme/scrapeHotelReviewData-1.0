ReviewText:Besides being a 4-star hotel, the Sheraton is in a great location if you plan to walk to most everything you will be doing in Boston. Some places still require a taxi or the "T," but we walked to Fenway Park and to Fanneil Hall and the Harbor and every where in between. Would recommend for everyone from anyone travelling for business or a family on vacation.

ReviewText:Good stuff: Location, location, location. Couldn't be better. Easy access to everything. Also friendly staff, particularly the woman who manages the valet parking and such, Kate. She was an encyclopedia of information about everything Boston, and Boston is a wonderful city. -newline-  -newline- Bad news: Parking. Outrageous cost. We found a parking lot across the street for "only" $29/night. You couldn't take the car in and out, but you really, really, really don't want to drive in Boston anyway. Not only is the traffic awful but the mantra is apparently "You can't get there from here." Taxis are a bit expensive too. The "T" metro is the best option, although again, at $2.50 a ride, one-way, it's expensive for a subway. Get a multi-use card, by all means. There's also a break for seniors, but you have to go somewhere and show proof of age to get a senior card; you can't do it at the machines in the stations. -newline-  -newline- As to the hotel, it was ordinary. Smallish room. A bit worn around the edges. Three of the four South Tower elevators were out of service, which makes for a real problem in the morning when everyone's trying to get out. Not a four star property; more like three. Not good value, at five start prices.

ReviewText:The hotel was ridiculously crowded on our day of arrival, and for the next 2 days. Friday and Saturday were better. It took a 30 minute wait in line to get -newline- checked in, only to find our room wasn't ready. The front desk and concierge were virtually inaccessible. The location is by far the best thing about this hotel, all else average.

ReviewText:We loved the location, central to everything and able to walk most places. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff very nice. It is very expensive to park your car at the hotel ($46 per night) and that was a negative. Overall a great experience and would stay again
