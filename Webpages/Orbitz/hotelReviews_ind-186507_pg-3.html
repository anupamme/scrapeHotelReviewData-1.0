ReviewText:I was a little concerned once I realized the location of this hotel (buzzer to get in the front door), but the front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful, the amenities of the hotel like 24 hour coffee and tea in the lobby and continental breakfast was just what I needed for a short stay. Bed was comfy and clean.

ReviewText:Staff was very friendly and helpful. We had two rooms in the outside area. Yes there is inside rooms and outside rooms. Hotel/motel? Free continental breakfast was simple but better than others I've had. Great location for us to walk the city. Coffee and tea in the lobby available at all times, we loved that.

ReviewText:Put us in the wrong room from the start. As I tried to unsuccessfully to open the room door with my card key it was opened by a gentleman in a towel who obviously just got out of the shower, and explained I had the wrong room. When I showed him my hand written room number, he showed me his and of course it was the same room. They apologized at the front desk and then as is often the case when you book through travel sites and not through them directly, proceeded to put us in the noisiest room in the hotel. When I asked to change rooms they said they were booked and could not accommodate us. I know this was not the case. Breakfast was sub-par at best. The second night there we hit the hay early as we had a crack of dawn flight out of San Francisco International, we were awakened at 12:30 a.m. by a angry man screaming at his female roommate as well as obviously hitting her, it was that loud and that obvious, I called to the front desk and reported the scenario. They said they would take care of it. After another hour of the same, I physically got out of bed and went to the front desk and threatened to call 911 if they did not take care of the situation. After about 20 minutes the yelling stopped. Needless to say I got no sleep. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody staying in the San Francisco area. On a side note, we were one of the few Americans in the hotel. Mostly European occupied.

ReviewText:The hotel was in the most ideal area of San Francisco for our trip!! Awesome staff and clean comfortable rooms! The parking is well worth the extra dollars they require. I will go back there on my next trip to the bay area.

ReviewText:Location was near where we were arriving via Amtrak bus and easily used MUNI buses to stadium. Older hotel with friendly staff with clean rooms. The bathroom was a little small and only one chair in the room, but the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Quiet and a very good value close to shopping in San Francisco. Enjoyed Mel's Diner located first floor.

ReviewText:Nothing exceptional except that there was a complimentary breakfast for all hotel guests, simple, down to earth but good. So, good value - saves some bucks, no need to chase around for a caf√© or diner in the morning. -newline- The location was a little bit 'off' - but for city walkers like us it was no problem. There are surprisingly many beggars and other destitute people in San Francisco, which is a bit of a surprise, but they are all over the place.

ReviewText:Overall, the hotel was too expensive for what we got out of it. We really just paid $250 a night for a good location and an old hotel. If it was renovated, it would be a better value, but the hotel is past its prime. Also another important note, parking at the hotel costs $30 a day which I found excessive. I wish we would have stayed across the bay in a hotel half the price and much nicer and we still would have paid the same for parking in the city when we came to visit. So really if you stay here you're just paying for a good location but I would recommend somewhere else.

ReviewText:The staff is very friendly. The location is great. You can easily walk to Union Square, and those that are fit can easily reach Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. The amenities are basic and it is a clean hotel. They have a wine reception on Wednesdays for 1 hour which was a nice touch.
