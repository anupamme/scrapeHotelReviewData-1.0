ReviewText:I wanted to love this place but it was horribly overpriced. We arrived to check in and the lobby was filled with people waiting for rooms, they were an hour late for check in and couldn't have been more rude. They lectured guests on the check in time instead of apologizing because they were clearly wrong. Instrad they made us and numerous other guests wait for hours in the lobby with our bags piled in the corner. The room was sub par for the price, zero sound proofing and the room felt like we had spent $50 not $180. They double charged us for valet, and after me telling them we only had one car they accused me of lying instead of checking with the valet first. Overall horrible stay. I wouldn't stay here for free...

ReviewText:The main complaint I have of the hotel is that I would appreciate overnight parking without an additional fee. The hotel doesn't specify parking clearly and it seems like it should be covered complementary with your stay. Other than that the grounds were beautiful and the bar connected to the lobby was excellent! I will be returning soon :)

ReviewText:perfect location for enjoying the gaslamp district. suggest an interior balcony room, as exterior balconies exposed to more street noise.

ReviewText:Supposedly "haunted" hotel! Love it. Very cute rooms with fireplace & old fashioned feel. Little sitting areas outside each floor. Look for something special in the elevator! Lots of history! Can't wait to go back!

ReviewText:The desk staff was very welcoming. The valet and bell-hop seemed under staffed but they tried. The hotel is very inviting and decorated in a classic Victorian style. The rooms are a good size; larger than the boutique hotels. The amenities were spot on and the bathroom was large enough for a big guy like me. The toilet had a vintage tank and flushing system. Well worth the money.
