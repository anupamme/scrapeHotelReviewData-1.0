ReviewText:As usual, the Embassy Suites puts on a good show. When you include the managers reception and the breakfast, this hotel is worth the money if you are in need of a suite. On this trip there were three guys, all who needed a separate bed. I ended up on the couch and enjoyed it. The front desk delivered a comforter and I slept comfortably on the couch. My friends said the beds were comfy also. -newline-  -newline- PRO's- Location on the bay, Walking distance to Seaport Village and the Midway museum, good service, free alcohol in the evening, free full breakfast (even made to order omelets if you desire), and a combination Baskin Robbins and Dunkin Donuts attached to the hotel. -newline-  -newline- CON's- Street parking is almost non-existent, Hotel Valet Parking is $40 a night (it does have in and out privileges, but there is also a customary tip each time you retrieve and park.)

ReviewText:We had a wonderful experience. It is a great location for walking to local destinations: Gaslamp, shopping, Ferry ride to Coronado and Sea Port Village. Nice breakfast and happy hour. I wish it had free internet and parking included.

ReviewText:I stayed at the embassy suites for 4 nights for a business trip. The hotel and room upkeep were great. The additional amenities of breakfast and happy hour were great bonuses. What I thought really put the finishing touches on the stay was the staff. Very courteous and friendly and willing to help when needed. -newline- The only downside to the hotel is lack of free wifi in rooms. You can get free wifi in the large lobby where thre are plenty of places to sit, but in the room would have been nice.

ReviewText:Great location, friendly and helpful staff, great amenities. Evening reception with complimentary drinks is a great perk when just arriving from out if town. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was good, great offerings and took away the time of having to find or drive somewhere for breakfast. -newline-  -newline- Only drawback was the $39 fee for valet. Found this to be a little outrageous.

ReviewText:Good location, is within easy walking distance to shopping, water front, restaurants, trolley and within a five minute drive to the Navy base if you're there to visit someone in the military.

ReviewText:the hotel was clean, room was clean. We were in a room above the kitchen and got the bacon smell at 4am, but that was the only demerit. The location is great. Parking is a little expensive, too, so beware.

ReviewText:We ended up booking a second room for our son and his family . They were in room 827 and the noise from above and around them was horrible 3 out of the 4 nights. They even called down to desk to request a different room. The request was not honored . For the cost of the room this was very disappointing.

ReviewText:We had one little run in with a valet attendant when we first arrived who was worthless but after that it was a very enjoyalbe stay. It was Labor Day weekend and I think he may have been brought in as an extra because I never saw him again and the rest of the group was awesome.
