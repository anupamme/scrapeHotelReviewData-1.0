ReviewText:The hotel is in the financial district, with great location for business trips and easy access to Faneuil Hall and other tourist locations. The hotel pool needs to be heated, it was a shock that it wasn't. The room was nice, but not as nice as the price would imply. The staff are nice and helpful, but fail to go above and beyond. A very good hotel, charging an excellent hotel price.

ReviewText:Excellent service and beautiful room. Received flowers from staff when I told them we had to leave a day early because my mother passed away. Great location. Would stay at any Intercontinental again and again.

ReviewText:This hotel was wonderful! The staff couldn't be more pleasant or accommodating; the room was spacious, spotless and had all the amenities; the restaurant Miel (never got to sample to Sushi Restaurant, much to our dismay# was outstanding; the location is literally 1 block from South Station and coming in by train from NYC made this ideal! It is also located right on the waterfront, so we were able to go for a nice walk along the water after dinner. We will definitely stay here again #and again, and again!)

ReviewText:Hotel charges a high service for having a package delivered. Also charges ridiculously high per page charge for printing. Business center only open until 11. The rooms are great but the business amenities are terrible.

ReviewText:This hotel is located by the Bay and allowed us the availability to walk to most historic destinations. The staff was very helpful to advise us and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable!!

ReviewText:The staff was very pleasant but my request for a room with a view of the water was ignored even though I'm a Priority Club member; instead, I got a view of an ugly rooftop to look at for three nights. I highly compliment the person or persons who cleaned our room on Friday, November 23. We left it a mess and came back to find it sparkling. We paid $40.00 a day for hotel parking for the convenience of valet service instead of using the cheaper public parking right next door. Still, to retrieve our car, no one drove it to the front entrance; we had to go down to the garage and wait for someone to find our car and drive it to the office. Next time, we'll just use public parking. Swimming pool was a disappointment. The food, drinks, and service at Miel and Rumba were pricey but excellent. Overall, the hotel was fine but not what one usually gets for five stars, more like four stars.
