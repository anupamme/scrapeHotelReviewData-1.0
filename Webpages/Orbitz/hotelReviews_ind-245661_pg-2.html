ReviewText:The location is in the heart of downtown San Diego so that was awesome. -newline-  -newline- Pros: lots of places were walking distance, amenities like 2 water bottles per day, free bike rentals, and free internet were included for a reasonable fee. -newline-  -newline- Cons: Since the only rooms available had only 1 bed, I requested a King bed so that my friend and I could sleep comfortably. They ran out of king beds so we were upgraded to a "suite" with a queen bed. The so-called suite was tiny. I can't imagine how uncomfortably small a regular room would have been. The floors were uneven in certain parts of the room which was strange. -newline-  -newline- If you're not planning to spend a lot of the time in the room, this hotel will be fine.

ReviewText:The hotel gave the expired coffee and Condiments dated before "19 Feb. 2013", which could harm the guest who did drink the coffee and use the condiments.

ReviewText:I really enjoyed my stay at the Sofia. The staff was super nice from the minute I arrived thru to checkout. I had a drink in the restaurant/lounge, Currants, and that was positive too. Plus there is a Tender Greens restaurant and a Coffee Bean on the same block which was handy. Lots of other great restaurants are an easy walk. The room was very well appointed. Being a historic hotel it is a bit on the small size as others have mentioned, but it was not a problem for me. My only complaint, and it is pretty minor, was that the room a/c made the room too cool when it cycled on and then too hot otherwise. I know, first world problem. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

ReviewText:Cute boutique hotel. Although the rooms are not big it was perfect for my partner and I. If you check in with yelp you get a free yoga DVD.

ReviewText:This hotel is unique compared to the average chain hotel. It is very charming inside. The room was on the smaller side given the cost for the night, but it was very nice! The largest bed the hotel offers is a queen, but it was very comfortable. -newline-  -newline- The hotel also has a room for yoga 24hr. They rent out bikes from 7am-7pm on a first come first serve basis, which is an awesome perk. That would be a fun way to get around the city!

ReviewText:Pretty hotel located within walking distance to the convention center and bay front. The Sophia had complementary bikes to use which we took advantage of to tour the city. The rooms were small but clean. Our one complaint was that there was a lot of traffic noise.
