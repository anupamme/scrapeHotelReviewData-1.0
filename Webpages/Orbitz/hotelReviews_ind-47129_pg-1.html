ReviewText:Room was clean & comfortable. Room service (& complimentary check in cookie) were delicious. Parking was slightly high considering we were staying at the hotel ($19 a day). Staff was pleasant but seemed "busy." They didn't t go out of they're way to see if there was any way to check in an hour earlier on day 1 and upon check out, the front desk person wasn't rude but not exactly what I would call friendly . Other than personality... The hotel & location were great for the price...

ReviewText:Room was clean, hotel amenities were great and staff were nice. Only issue I had was having to pay extra to rent a fridge and microwave. That was ridiculous. I've never stayed in a hotel where I had to rent a microwave and fridge. Our bathroom sink was horrible. Clogged and super slow draining. And sometimes would spit up brown stuff. Other than those issues, we had a great stay.

ReviewText:Nice hotel, clean, staff was very responsive. We were close to USD (attending a graduation) and Old Town San Diego. The only con is that it sits back in a shopping center and it is difficult to locate the entrance the first time.

ReviewText:The room was clean. The staff was polite and helpful. The only issue was the parking. The driveway to the entrance of the hotel is under construction. There was no marked detour or alternative entrance. So we had to go in and out of the "exit only" all weekend.
