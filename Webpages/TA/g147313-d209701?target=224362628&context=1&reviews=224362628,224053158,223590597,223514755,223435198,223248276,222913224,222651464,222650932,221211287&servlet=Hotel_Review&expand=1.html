We spent a week at the RPTB August 5-12. We were also there in December. It is a beautiful property, with workers constantly cleaning and maintaining its beauty. The beachfront and ocean are also amazing, but no waves, if you are into that. <br/> I feel that the food quality has dropped a notch since last year, and it wasn’t that great then. I would give it an overall C+. One example, no beef filet at the Italian restaurant this year. They really need to upgrade the desserts as well, both in the restaurants and the buffets. They also will only reserve 1 night at the restaurants at a time instead of 2 which they did last time. That means you have to get in line everyday to reserve a restaurant instead of every other day, which is a pain<br/> A big plus was Andrew, a front desk manager who is a very customer service oriented individual. He came to our room personally to address an issue. He is a big reason why we will go back. <br/> A tip for those like salt on their food, bring a toothpick, most of the salt shakers are clogged due to the humidity

This was our first all inclusive experience and overall, it was a great experience.<br/><br/>Food: <br/>The food was really good. I'd say stick to the buffet. We only tried the Italian restaurant and we were not impressed at all. We ended up going to the buffet after because we didn't like/eat the food at the restaurant. Others did say they liked the restaurants so it could just be us. The buffet was more than fine for us, so we were happy to stick with that.<br/><br/>If you do decide to eat at the restaurants, know that they are pretty small and can fill up quickly (especially the first couple of days because people are eager to try them).<br/><br/>We were dissappointed that there wasnt a place we could get food 24hrs. You can order room service at any time but its a bit inconvenient if you're having a good time at the bar.<br/><br/>Beach/Pool<br/>The beach was amazing! The water was so clear and warm. Even as it got later into the afternoon, we would still be in the water.<br/><br/>The hotel staff did a good job at coming around ever so often to see of those at the beach would like any drinks and they brought them in a relatively timely manner<br/><br/>There are a lot of locals who walk the beach trying to sell little nick knacks. If you're not interested, just tell them no and they'll leave you alone<br/><br/>You can also take a nice long walk along the beachfront...its connected to a couple of the other hotels as well and there are little shops and things along the way<br/><br/>The pool bar is the place to be during the day. Jermaine is an awesome guy and was quick to get us whatever we wanted. They host a few games throughout the day that make it entertaining so definitely stick around a bit.<br/><br/>Nightlife/Entertainment:<br/>There's one 24hr bar. Its not very busy late at night but look out for O'neil - he's a great guy and will definitely take care of you.<br/><br/>Guests at the riu palace can eat, drink and party at the riu negril, but they don't have any bars open 24hrs and their club was nothing to get excited about. We went twice and there were hardly any people there. They also closed at 2am and apparently ran out of all alcohol except rum around 1:30 so we ended up just walking back to our hotel.<br/><br/>The entertainment crew is very talented. They put on a show every night and host the day activities. They definitely know how to get people engaged and having fun. <br/>The room:<br/>The room was pretty basic. Comfortable and clean. Nothing extraordinary but we didn't spend much time in the room so we were fine with it. The cleaning staff are amazing. We had Shirley and she must have come into the room 2-3 times a day. <br/><br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely stay there again. We had a great time and felt like our money was very well spent.<br/><br/>

I have just returned home from a 10 day holiday at the Riu Palace Tropical Bay Negril.<br/>This is my first visit to Jamaica and I would love to return.<br/>The Riu Palace is located right on the beach it's beautiful, white sands and crystal clear sea.The sea was so warm just like getting into a warm bath!<br/> I have stayed in many Riu hotel's and was therefore not surprised by the design, layout and décor.<br/>Food standards and choice were very good, with the added bonus of speciality restaurants, try the Italian &amp; The Steak House well worth visiting.<br/>The bar staff, waiting on staff and entertainment team were absolutely brilliant, they all work incredibly hard. Look out for Sandie, Sweetie, Popcorn, Chicken &amp; Ojay.<br/>Part of my holiday was also to attend a family friends wedding it was incredible from start to finish.<br/>The Riu group needs to consider refurbishing the bedroom's mine was certainly looking tired, housekeeping was also very &quot;hit and miss&quot; a quality assurance scheme needs introducing!<br/>The only negative on this holiday was the continuous biting from Mosquitoes!!! Everyone in the hotel was bitten,despite using 3 cans of repellant and wearing insect repellant wrist bands I managed to get 63 bites!!! The hotel did fumigate twice during my stay so I can only assume guest's had been complaining? So be prepared for this.<br/>All in all a great all inclusive holiday.

We were there from August 12-19. The Palace is a small resort with 2 small pools. We arrived at the lobby and were given our room keys and 2 towel cards and our bracelets and were on our way. No formal greeting, no welcoming drink. Our porter took us to our suite. We have had hotel rooms larger than this suite. There was no clock, no radio, a small bathroom with a narrow tub with a stand up shower. As I have just recently had a knee replacement and am scheduled for a new hip in September the high ledge entrance to the tub/shower was an adventure. The bed was a full king size bed and not 2 double beds put together as others have noted. The refrigerator was cold and always well stocked. 4 different liquors were there for our use but I only used the rum. None of this was a deal breaker. How much time do you spend in the room anyway?<br/> Dinner started at 6:30 and it was about 4 in the afternoon and we hadn't eaten since early breakfast in Pittsburgh so we looked at the room service menu. The choices were rather limited, so we ventured to the buffet at the opening. We were greeted by Althea. When she found out this was our first time there she gave us a tour of the buffet. Every day she escorted us to out table and remembered what we liked to eat. In conversation we mentioned we were celebrating my wife's birthday and on that day the staff brought out a cake and sang Happy Birthday to her. In the morning Mario was our waiter and always had coffee ready for us at a table near a window. Thanks Mario and Althea you made our dining experience a treat and you, as well as all waiters and waitresses, work hard.<br/> Another problem here is the a a carte reservation system. There are 4 a la cartes but the problem is you have to reserve them for the next day. So, at 8 in the morning, the staff starts taking reservations. We arrived on Tuesday and ate in the buffet. Wednesday morning I arrived near 8 and was the 4th in line and got a reservation for the steak house but the reservation was for the next day. So the first 2 days you eat in the buffet. <br/> We went to the steak house and I had the strip steak and my wife had the lobster. The lobster was delicious she said but the steak was fatty and tough even though I ordered it medium rare. We think the a la cartes should be better than the buffets but after just the one a la carte we decided to stick with the buffets. The buffet always had different choices. There was the American corner with hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza. Saw lots of kids with that. But when in Jamaica eat like a Jamaican. During the week I had curried goat, oxtail, rice and peas, ackee and saltfish, etc. I liked the variety and the small portions offered as I was able to sample so many different things. The desserts deserve a mention on their own. Great mousses, etc. One day there was a chocolate fountain with fruit. <br/> The beach had smooth white sand and the calmest clear water we have ever seen. My wife can't swim but she spent a lot of time in the water with water up to her shoulders. The only problem with the beach is the lack of palapas. We are in our 60's (closer to 70) and now we need shade time when not in the water. There is morning to early afternoon shade with the trees but from mid afternoon on you see people moving their loungers back behind the trees to follow the shade. To me this is a problem. The resort next door has palapas on the beach.<br/> There are vendors passing by often but they were no problem. A couple of times my wife was offered weed. We enjoyed the strolling guitar players and one group of 4 who would stop and play for a couple of dollars. Really a fun beach.<br/> The shows were great. We had several opportunities to talk with the entertainers. A special shout out to Tweetie, Sweetie, Chicken, Popcorn, O. J., the girl D. J. (Sorry, I don't remember your name) and all the others who entertained us all week. These young people are professionals in every sense of the word and everyone should take in a show or 2 the week you are there. We had the same seats every night (right next to Queenie from New York and her group) and really enjoyed the shows. These professionals work hard all day with no air conditioning back stage and on the stage. They practice from 8;30 to 5 every day. They have to know 14 different shows!! Some reviewers complain that they are not broadway shows. 14 different shows each week! Come on people, take in at least one show and watch and applaud. That is the least anyone can do and the entertainers would sure appreciate it.<br/> Chicken led the water aerobics that my wife enjoyed every day. His personality made it fun she said. With my knee replacement and hip replacement to be in September I could not participate. But I watched and was proud of my wife keeping up even though ones half her age were dropping out. Since I am a retired basketball coach she knew what was expected of her.<br/> We at the Palace had exchange privileges with the Riu Negril which was down the beach but separated by another resort. The front desk said the beach was safe to walk at daytime but they did not recommend walking at night. They said taxis were available. Why not a van provided at night so we could go see the shows at both resorts?<br/> All in all it was a pleasant experience because of the beach, the food, and the wonderful people mentioned above as well as everyone else. In all honesty I did not encounter one disgruntled employee. And a note to some of the entertainers who said they read the reviews. Don't give up on your hopes and dreams. You made our week special.

My daughter &amp; I so enjoyed everything about our trip to Jamaica....The Riu Palace Tropical Bay is a wonderful resort. We stayed in a beach front junior suite &amp; enjoyed sitting on our balcony looking out over the beautiful beach. The food at the buffet was great...whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Steakhouse was good, but a hassle to get reservations. Had to be at the lobby by 7AM to try to get a reservation. We appreciated the friendliness of all the staff...front desk, housekeeping, bartenders...everyone that we dealt with at the Riu. A late afternoon Catamaran Cruise to Rick's Café is a MUST when in Negril. What a fun time that was. We also took a road trip by van to the south of the island (1 1/2 hours one way) to the Black River for a scenic boat ride. After that we enjoyed a delicious lunch &amp; headed to the YS Falls...beautiful. Then we headed back to the Riu. It was quite interesting to see the Jamaican countryside away from the resort. Our guide gave us so much information about the lifestyles of the people in the villages. I highly recommend this 8 hour experience to everyone. As I always wanted to parasail, but never did, Jamaica was the place to check that off my bucket list. So finally at the young age of 70, my daughter &amp; I parasailed. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. We wanted to visit the Riu Negril Resort, across the bay, so we took a paddle boat over &amp; enjoyed a cocktail at their pool bar...I would love to take my husband to the Riu Palace Tropical Bay to see &amp; enjoy the beach as much as I did.....the most beautiful clean, clear, calm beach that I have ever been to. There was a Hut on the beach that served Jerk chicken &amp; sides at lunch time. Delicious...The only thing I would have changed is to request a room closer to the lobby...we were in building 6....as far away as you can be. Our trip to Jamaica is one to remember...

We were a group of 37 coming to celebrate our daughter's wedding. We booked with Megan Whalan from Honeymoons, Inc. based in GA. We cannot say enough good things about Megan as she did an excellent job delivering a semi-stress free double event. We had a wonderful stay, though there were minor issues w/ the front desk. We encountered Judean at the front desk. She was so amazingly helpful, friendly and professional. And we were advised that she was merely a trainee, WOW, good job Judean. Sherleene, on the other hand was unpleasant, unprofessional and hard to deal with. She attempted to have us sign a contract stating that we will agree to pay for an international call (toll free #) to our travel agent as they had listed our 23 y/o son as a child. We refused to sign and requested the help of her supervisor. She came to her rescue when we again pointed to the travel agency voucher which clearly indicated that he was an adult. We wasted a good 45 minutes trying to resolve this dilemma. No apologies were provided afterwards. Sophie Haughton, the wedding coordinator did a good job and provided ample info to make our stay memorable. <br/><br/>A complaint was with their reservation system. It definitely needs improvement. With a party of 37, I could understand they can only accommodate 8-10 of our guests at a time as other guests need to benefit from the specialty restaurants. But when the restaurant is half-empty at a 6:30 pm seating, you tend to question their reasoning. Another issue was we could often hear the staff very clearly near our door in the early morning and since I am a light sleeper, I would often wake up. That was kind of annoying.<br/><br/>This was our second trip to Jamaica and we have vacationed at numerous all-inclusive resorts through the Caribbean and Europe. This time, our daughter and us both stayed at a waterfront suite, second floor, building 3. Most of our guests were close to proximity. The staff was friendly and most of them will greet you by first name with a warm smile. The buffet at the Negril restaurant was as good as the food at the specialty restaurants. We managed to sample food at all four restaurants and Krystal is our favorite. The steakhouse is second, followed by the Japanese, then the Italian. We would stop by the lobby bar for a drink before going down to dinner and listen to the gentleman playing piano. He was great! The bartender there was really nice and made great drinks. The activity staff was quite energetic whether they were by the beach, pool area or performing at night. They really attempt to get the guests involved and work so hard at what they do. Kudos to all of them. The evening entertainment was good especially the M Jackson show and the steel band. The beach was awesome. We didn't use the pool as the beach was so inviting; warm, calm, blue water with a sandy shallow bottom. Simply perfect. My husband got me a star fish and had it dried on the balcony. We brought it back to the States as a nice remembrance of our stay. We had short showers/rain every day in mid-afternoon. <br/><br/>We had our double event by the gazebo on the left. Our pastor/friend performed a wonderful ceremony. The vows were beautiful and so perfect to the occasion. The reception was a pure delight. We brought our own centerpieces, overlays, name tags and it was very pleasing to the eyes. The food was delicious, our table had the lobster meal and our guests are still raving about how tender and delicious it was. The gentleman who was in charge, Samuel and his crew did an excellent job. They were an extremely professional and accommodating crew and Samuel took much pride in making sure everything was okay. It was nice to see someone who took such pride in the service he provided. I can't say enough nice things about Samuel. Too many people today do the bare minimum required in their jobs, so it was refreshing to see someone excel at what he does. <br/><br/>I must add that after the reception, we all gathered in the steakhouse to dance the night away as we had rented the entire restaurant for 2 hours (9-11PM). Alas, it was a total bust. For some reason, the blue tooth speaker system we brought did not function properly. It will start and drop off the music right in the middle of the song. We were so disappointed. It was not RIU's fault of course, nevertheless heartbreaking for my daughter not to have her first dance w/ her dad and my w/ my son in law. <br/><br/>We closed up that enchanting day by going to the beach and lighting our Chinese lanterns. We had about 50 of them. This made up for the dance fiasco. It was simply magical. <br/><br/>Special thanks to Sophie, Judean, Germain, Samuel and his crew. You guys make this place rock!!!

We have been vacationing in Jamaica for 6 summers, 5 at this resort. Each trip has been super. The staff is cordial and goes out of their way to make you feel like you are &quot;coming home&quot;. Kudos to Jackie at the evening buffet. She even decorated our table with flowers for our anniversary. We were in building 6 facing the ocean. Unfortunately while we were there the ice machine literally blew up with a fire lighting up the night. No other problems that were not attended to promptly. One negative that had nothing to do with the resort happened at the airport when Frontier lost their computer ability so for 1 1/2 hours was spent at the check in only to see other passengers leaving after we had paid extra for preferred perks. Disappointment at not having time to shop at the airport. However, there is always next year. We will return to the Riu Palace. Love, love, love Jamaica!

<p>
I'd like to preface this by saying that we have traveled all through the Caribbean and this was our third trip to Jamaica. We've stayed at numerous all-inclusive resorts including Iberostar, Beaches, Occidental Royal Club as well as the Riu Palace in Punta Cana and Riviera Maya and have never had the issues encountered at the Tropical Bay resort. The trip wasn't a total bust so I'll list the pro's first:<br/><br/>The bar and wait staff were amazing. Encountered happy, friendly, accommodating folks in the lobby bar and the buffet restaurant. Althea and Avory welcomed us each evening making sure all nine of us could sit and have dinner together. The food was above average for an all- inclusive resort. There is a nice variety of everything from fresh fruits and salads to gourmet quality desserts. We also had very nice meals in the Steak House as well as Krystal. For the most part, staff all around the resort will great you with a warm, welcoming smile. As I sat in the lobby one evening, Beverly (who was busy keeping the area tidy) approached me with her beautiful smile just to ask if I was enjoying my day. It's the little things like this that would make you want to go back again, HOWEVER, here comes the cons:<br/><br/>We had no clock in our room. Since I didn't bring a watch, computer or cell phone, it was an inconvenience. We had family in three other rooms and all had clocks. Called the front desk to ask for a clock and was told they did not provide clocks in the rooms and if I wanted to know the correct time, I could walk [half way across the resort] to the lobby 24/hrs./day to check their clock!<br/><br/>Housekeeping was also lacking. When our room was made up, we received only bath towels. Each day we had to chase down a housekeeper to get hand towels and we were never able to get wash cloths or floor mats, only excuses.<br/><br/>Our major issue was with the key cards for the doors. Six times during the week (four in one day) we had problems with cards not working. The cards not working were not as annoying as the attitude of the front desk staff. Rather than just addressing the issue, they wanted to know what I had done to the cards. As it turned out, they had cancelled all the cards as if we had checked out of the resort. Had they been apologetic, it wouldn't have been a big deal but when I got attitude on top of ineptitude, enough was enough.<br/><br/>Their reservation system for a la carte restaurants is very inconvenient. You can only make reservations each morning for the following evening. Since we were a party of nine, I got to the lobby by 7am to ensure we would be accommodated. After sitting there for an hour, the staff arrived to begin taking the reservations for the following night. As I was about to make the reservations for my family, a member of the Riu staff ushers a gentleman in front of me. I was told he had an 8am excursion so he needed to make his reservations in a hurry. I was livid. He should have been there, as I was, at 7am or just eat at the buffet.<br/><br/>The evening before we checked out, I made it a point to see the resort managers to address my complaints. It was a huge waste of time. No apologies, lots of excuses. They actually had the nerve to tell me about their great reviews.<br/><br/>If you're going to Jamaica, check out Iberostar. We have stayed there before and should have went back this time. Lesson learned.

This was our first time to Jamaica, and first time in a RIU Hotel. We have to say it was out of this world. The room was great with a daily restocked fridge full of Red Stripe. The service and the people made our holiday, they were so caring and attentive, especially Sharon, Tony, Shereen and Kerisha. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone and everyone! The food was incredible from the buffet, through to the steak house where the surf and turf was out of this world. Every cocktail was sampled and enjoyed thoroughly. Every member of staff had a smile on their face and couldn't do enough for you. Highly recommend the evening entertainment especially the steel band WOW! A trip to Rick's is a must and the Scube Carribe Snorkel and Rick's Café trip is excellent value for money. We would have loved to have done more trips but the hotel was so fantastic it was hard to leave!

Just returned from our third trip to the Riu Tropical Bay. This trip was for our honeymoon. We enjoyed every second of our trip. The quality of the service was fantastic. The quality of the food was outstanding. The wait staff couldn't have been more attentive. Ragga from the Negril buffet is one the most attentive and best waiters I have every seen. The bar staff was very attentive. Kevin, Andre, Andrew and others from the bar staff kept the drinks flowing. The entertainment staff was fantastic. Chicken, Popcorn, Sweetie, Tweetie, etc. kept us entertained all day. These people work their butts off to make certain you enjoy your vacation. The cleaning and grounds staff worked around the clock to kept the resort in tip top shape. These guys and girls were constantly working. In short, it was an amazing vacation. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone considering going to Negril. We are already planning our family vacation for next year.
