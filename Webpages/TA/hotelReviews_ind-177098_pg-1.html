ReviewText:This hotel is a great for travelers who are looking for an easy accomodation. The room is clean and the staff is very helpful and they have a great attitude. Our room was small for a couple and may even feel small for some but that's what you expect from a place in this location.

ReviewText:We were greeted with very personable and helpful staff upon arrival. The room was very simple, but had everything that we would've needed. It had a European minimalist type feel. The location was perfect for us and we were able to go on foot anywhere we needed. We only had to stay a night but would be happy to stay again.

ReviewText:Went there for a weekend stay and they are great! Staff was friendly and checkin was fast. Free wifi, free printing serving, and your room has great features. Places I've stayed at while visiting weren't so stocked with great features such as, flat screen tv's that adjusted to different angles on the way, small coffee machine, mini fridge, microwave, additional plugs right on your nightstand that was perfect for devises, cool alarm/iPhone music player so you can plug your phone in to charge and play music from your phone, huge desk to do business, and spacious compared to most hotels in San Fran. Right when you walk out, Starbucks is 30ft away so you have that just in case you don't want to make coffee in your room. Plus they had purified water on floors 2-8, where they provided you with individual water bottles and a machine for purified water to fill up and bring to your room, which is great for people who absolute need to have cold water in the night. Standard hair dryer I your room but no ironing board and iron, you have to request for those items to be brought to your room. The location is decent, it's by a tom of locations for your to walk to since your in the financial district but they have a few local places around and on Sundays they are mostly closed since it's downtown area. We took a taxi to most if the locations. It's a small 7-10 min walk to little Italy and the other bars so that's a plus but most other places you'll think about taking a cab unless you love walking. Overall the place was great and I would stay again!

ReviewText:Arrived early on Friday and was able to walk to the hotel from the BART station with no problems. We were allowed to check in early, and the staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions. Elevators would only allow access to the floors if you swiped your room card, so the added security was a nice surprise. The room was clean and comfortable. The only problem we encountered was with the AC. We notified the front desk when we left one morning for breakfast, and when we returned we were told the issue had been addressed. The units are eco friendly and only kick on when there is movement in the room, so if you want it to continue to cool through the night you have to turn on the fan. Walls are a little thin and you could hear the alarm in the room next to us in the morning, but not a real issue. We stayed for three nights and were very pleased with everything. The location is wonderful and really within walking distance to just about everything you could want.
