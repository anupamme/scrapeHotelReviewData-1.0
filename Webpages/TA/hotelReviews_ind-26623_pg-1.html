ReviewText:Welcome from the moment I entered the hotel. Front desk staff cheerful. Housekeeping was superb, and I left a modest tip; she left me a handwritten note thanking me. This classic hotel is steps from so many things to do in San Francisco. The daily one hour wine hour included off the lobby makes it perfect and a great place to make new friends. My meeting was at the Hyatt, but this one block away location was perfect. The elevators are older, but ran pretty well. Room service was also honest on timing and very good.

ReviewText:It was my Birthday trip to San Francisco. We were immediately up-grated upon arrival to a bigger room. The staff was super friendly and happy to see us. The concierges gave us many options to explore the city. We booked several tourist destinations with them. Fast and convenient service. -newline- The Hotel is beautiful inside and out. Luxury without being over the top. The Bar is a welcoming feature entering the Hotel, you must stop and have a drink there. the bartenders are the nicest! -newline- The restaurant is pricy - but so worth it. The waiters were so knowledgeable and friendly, making our Dinner experience extra special. -newline- The Starlight Room on the top floor is a MUST SEE! -newline- We had my Birthday up there and it was awesome. Delicious appetizers and drinks serviced by the most friendliest and (most beautiful) waiter/staff in the city. -newline- The location is simply perfect. Everything you need and want to do is right there. Around the corner , up the street or right in front of your nose. -newline- We loved it there and we love the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. We will absolutely return to this great San Francisco Landmark, and to the most accommodating and courteous, professional, excellent service we've ever had. -newline- If you decide to visit them, you are in for a treat!!!

ReviewText:The Drake is a beautiful place with very polite and helpful staff. However, the noise was awful. We were on the third floor and the street noise kept us up all night long. The cable cars along with vehicles and people noises sounded like they were only three feet away. I believe the windows to be the original thin pane glass installed in 1928. We might as well have had them open. I would not recommend. I also wish we had known up front that we would be charged $62.00 per night for parking.

ReviewText:Our main complaint is that the room felt extremely small. The bathroom was especially difficult to move around in for putting on makeup, etc. -newline- I booked a massage that was disappointing, not the therapist but the hotel seemed overwhelmed with 2 clients at the same time; no room for the massage table in the room and no table available at the correct time. It had to be borrowed from another hotel. It took about half an hour to find a room suitable to set up the table, etc., meanwhile I wandered around the hotel in my pajamas and spa robe. I would have chose not to do that. The concierge service was excellent as was the maid service. I did order an additional blanket when I first got in on Saturday night which never came. I called two days later to request it again. It came quickly this time. The massage therapist was excellent but the whole experience was too costly considering the inconvenience.

ReviewText:When arriving at the hotel, I was not only greeted with a $57 valet parking fee, but also a grinch of a host! I was also surprised to find a "closet" sized room and a tinge of unpleasant odor. The Starlight Lounge offered the best view, but the weakest cocktail. To be honest, I couldn't wait to go to check out!
