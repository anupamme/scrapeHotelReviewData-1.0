ReviewText:The hotel has a good location, the bathroom is very small, the room has a good size and the view of the bay is very nice. The rooms are okay but the carpet could be changed.

ReviewText:Excellent location for return trip with son (15) and husband (on first trip to sanF). My favourite Kimpton of several - it really is an ideal spot to walk Pier 39, reach Alcatraz Landing (the night tour is truly awesome, we did this instead of day tour this time) and' bike the bridge'. With CityPasses we made the most of all types of transport, the fab De Young and CA Acaedemy of Science. 10 days (due to the long flight from UK) allowed us plenty of time to explore a district each day. The Argonaut has a spacious lobby and v well attended wine reception each day! Waterfront location with the bleachers and beach is a great reading spot when all walked out. Staff are excellent.

ReviewText:I arrived at the Argonaut before check-in, which is at 3pm. Because I was in San Francisco for a short weekend trip, I was sad to waste even an hour of the time I had to explore the city. The hotel staff was very accommodating and held onto all my luggage so I could leave the hotel, and offered to bring it up to my room when I got back. I appreciated this so much! -newline-  -newline- Waiting wouldn't have been all that bad, because the lounge area is nice and has self-serve cucumber water.

ReviewText:The only ding is the parking but it really is kind of expected due to the location so not a big deal. The rooms are nice and the location is great. The staff is friendly and helpful so no real complaints.

ReviewText:Perfect location, as soon as you step into the hotel it feels comfortable and homely. Polite and friendly staff. On checking out there had been an $8 error on our bill for use of Mini bar which we hadn't used. This was promptly deducted. From 5-6pm they serve complimentary wine, beer and apple cider, it was a lovely way to unwind after sight seeing.
