ReviewText:Perfect location. Walking distance to union square. Plenty of restaurants and bars around. Easy to get to all attractions in San Francisco....staff was so accommodating. The entire hotel including the rooms were in great condition. Had an old feel but very updated. Couldn't have asked for anything better.

ReviewText:The room was very clean and pretty comfortable, but the prices were a little out there. You had to pay for parking and wifi. We were not greeted as much as the older customers. I would have liked a better located hotel. There were too many cable car rides, which took up lots of precious vacation time. It was a fun experience to ride them, but I think I would have liked something closer to the piers because we went there almost every night. Waiting late at night in the cold for a cable car or street car was not fun.

ReviewText:The hotel staff's service is fantastic. They are clearly very well trained, thoughtful, considerate and excel at pleasing. They make you feel at home and remember who you are as well as ask what they can do for you. The hotel is a historical landmark and in very good condition. We were very pleased and will go back again. Loved San Francisco and the sites. Great location as well.
