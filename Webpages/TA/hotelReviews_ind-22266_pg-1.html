ReviewText:I stayed in room 1658 at the Hilton on OFarrell this week. Its an interior room facing the pool. Too bad the kids weren't with me this trip. A little noisy out there at 9p but nothing terrible. This is a very busy hotel and I was very glad that Hilton offered me the opportunity to check in early for $25. Totally worth it for me. The only negative to this hotel is the location. Its close to Union Square but its in a rougher part of SF.

ReviewText:The hotel is quite big. You have that big entrance hall, a Starbucks is just on the left if you enter the hotel. The rooms are in 3 towers. We had a room with 2 king size beds, it was clean and tidy, and staff was helpful and friendly! -newline- The hotel has their own private-"taxis" too, which cost you only 40 dollars from San Francisco International Airport, that's less expensive than normal taxis.

ReviewText:Needs update to become 4 star. They didn't have a refrigerator in the room but quickly provided one at my request. Basically, considering the price and location, I was satisfied.

ReviewText:The hotel was very close to MUNI, but far from the cool neighborhoods. Very clean, staff was fantastic. Room was comfortable, but not overwhelmingly nice. Don't know if it was worth the huge price tag.

ReviewText:Although our room was nice and available at a reasonable rate, the hotel makes up for it by gouging you financially on every other front. From exorbitant wifi fees, to the $10 cup of coffee that was worse than any cup of instant I've ever tasted. Combined with their parking fees, you will easily end up spending more per day on all the miscellaneous stuff than for your nightly rate. -newline-  -newline- Our in room coffee maker was broken and a replacement was not delivered either. I'm never going back to this hotel again.

ReviewText:Staying at the Hilton was a great value. The rooms are huge, but they are adequate and clean. The hotel is in and great location, and the rooftop pool and fitness club make it a great place to spend time in between sight seeing.
