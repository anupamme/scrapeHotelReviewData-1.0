ReviewText:I spent four nights at this hotel at the end of a 14 day trip from Seattle to San Francisco. I had really been looking forward to my stay here. I had spent days researching hotels in the city and decided to pay extra to stay in this hotel, and I must admit I was a bit disappointed. In general, it was a nice hotel with a great location, but it fell short of my expectations, particularly for how much it cost. -newline-  -newline- The room: The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. However, it was much smaller than I'd imagined (the pictures are very deceiving), and the decor and furnishings are rather outdated. -newline-  -newline- Service/Amenities: The maid service was okay, but I was surprised they didn't replace the dirty glasses I used or the ice bucket liner. Cable was not HD quality and there was no safe in the room. There was no ice machine on my floor (7th) so I had to take the elevator down to the 1st floor. There were frequest issues with the elevators, and often only 1 out of 3 was working. -newline-  -newline- Staff: The staff members I interacted with were great, and very friendly--particularly the valets. One in particular remembered me from the first day and welcomed me back every time I saw him. The restaurant staff were good and the concierge was helpful. -newline-  -newline- Location: The location was fantastic! Both the California and Powell line cablecars stop right outside. Many of the muni buses stop within a block or two of the hotel (though be prepared that those are steep uphill blocks). Chinatown and Union Square are within very close walking distance, and the historic "Top of the Mark" (cocktail lounge with a 360 view at the top of the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel) is right next door. -newline-  -newline- All in all, this hotel provided a comfortable night's sleep and a great starting point for my daily excursions around the city. But the size of the room, the elevator troubles and the lackluster decor and maid service did not live up to the 4-star luxury accommodations I anticipated.

ReviewText:Stanford Court exceeded our expectations. Very helpful staff, great location, comfortable rooms, and you never feel like you are getting nickel and dimed (e.g, for water in the room) as at some hotels.

ReviewText:First time visiting san fransisco. Was very pleased with this hotel. Check in was great and they allowed us to check in early and even upgraded us to a city view room. Nice clean room and close to everything. Shopping at union square was a ten minute walk and cable car stop right outside front of hotel. Would definitely come back and recommend to others

ReviewText:I was expecting an interesting, unique boutique hotel and what it felt like was a hotel in transition. Not quite there. Totally comfortable but nothing that special for the price.
