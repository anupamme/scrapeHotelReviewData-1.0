ReviewText:We stayed 2 nights after an alaska cruise. The hotel is pretty new for city. We had a high floor which had nice views of the water and our package included access to the club / concierge floor for breakfast. The fitness center was quite nice as well. -newline-  -newline- The only downside is the location is right by the convention center -- on the 'other' side of Market street which gets a little sketchy at night.

ReviewText:Excellent location in SOMA close to downtown attractions. Wonderful staff who were extremely friendly and attentive with a very knowledgeable concierge desk. Arrived before check-in expecting to leave our luggage and come back, but was quickly checked in to our room without having to wait.

ReviewText:The hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff was incredibly helpful with any all requests. The location of the hotel is good in that it allows quick access to the SOMA neighborhood (where it is located) in addition to the Financial District and Union Square. Any other destinations are also easily reachable by cable car, which are only a few blocks away. Overall, this is a great hotel with a great staff, great rooms, and great amenities.

ReviewText:Location is convenient for access to ATT Park, the wharf, taxis, highway, etc. Nice little pub next door. Staff was helpful, hotel and room was lovely. valet parking is pricey as per usual, but the hotel valet informed us there was a parking lot behind the hotel that was half the price if we weren't planning to use our car much. Good tip, since we walked and took cabs everywhere for much cheaper. This hotel doesn't offer free wifi if you're here for business. Overall good stay, will stay again.

ReviewText:Best location south of Market. Nice fitness center. Good breakfast, albeit expensive. Friendly service. Parking hideously expensive but to be expected. Would stay again.

ReviewText:Checked in at 11:15pm after seeing Willie Nelson in Berkeley, valet-ed the car, met friends at the bar, walked to see dueling pianos @ Union Square, back at ~2. Simple checkout in the morning. Place is clean, comfortable. Umbrella in the closet.
