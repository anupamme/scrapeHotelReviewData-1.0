ReviewText:The Opal has everything you need in a hotel while sightseeing or visiting for a special occasion, conference, etc. (I was there for a combination of a vacation and a family wedding.) It's comfortable, quiet, and clean. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and housekeeping does their job well. It is an older building, and lacks luxury amenities; e.g. there isn't a refrigerator in the room and the selection of free toiletries is limited. But, if you do any research before booking, you should be aware that this is not a luxury experience; it's a practical place to sleep and store your possessions. The continental breakfast is halfway decent if you stick to muffins and coffee, but there are a number of good places in the surrounding blocks to purchase espresso beverages and a more, um, filling repast for your mornings. Although it's not close to any notable attractions, the Opal is ideally located on two of the most useful MUNI bus routes (the 38/38L on Geary and the 47/49 on Van Ness), and not too far a walk from the BART or MUNI metro at Van Ness and Market. It's on the western edge of the Tenderloin, which is a sketchy (but not dangerous) area and fine in the daytime, unless you're a very easily freaked out suburban type. Polk, the north-south street immediately east of Van Ness, has been gentrified to a reasonable degree and sports mini-marts, cafes, restaurants, and bars; the TL also has great Afghan, Indian, and Southeast Asian restaurants. In short, I'd recommend the Opal, if you're not too much of a diva about extraneous amenities.

ReviewText:Very old, room was small. AC unit had a high pitched steamy squeal (maintenance did quiet it down.) Floor had a steep slope to it. Glad it was only one night. On the plus side, there is a parking garage close by where you can park for $26/day which is cheap in SF.

ReviewText:The Opal Hotel in San Francisco was not what I am accustomed to. The hotel is older and definitely needs a more modern upgrade. The location was a distance from where the event we came in to town for.

ReviewText:I was hesitant to book a hotel I hadn't stayed at or knew someone that had in San Francisco. In addition, one that is in the Tenderloin (even if on the edge). -newline-  -newline- But, afterwards I am glad that I tried this hotel. Rooms were nice, lobby was nice and "secured" (see below), and the hotel was quiet even in the Tenderloin. Also in a great location to take Muni or use a ride share (off major streets). -newline-  -newline- Down sides: cleanliness left something to be desired, the "secured" locked door was opened by the front desk without actually speaking to you on the intercom--a feeling of more for show--and the staff at the front desk moves fairly slow so there was a wait to check-in and out.

ReviewText:We found this hotel late---just a few days prior to arrival---for way less than the surrounding places. The staff was very friendly, and the hotel offered a complimentary wine and cheese sampling the night of our arrival. The amenities are few, but we were there to see the city, not the inside of a hotel.

ReviewText:Upon first glance in the lobby one is greeted with Stain Glass doors off to the side and a lobby desk that looks like a concession stand from an old Theatre, but then I read the history and discovered it is an old hotel. The room was large, with a nice sitting area, but it could use a face lift. It was clean just worn. So overall an Ok place to stay, but not amazing. -newline- Things to be aware of...housekeeping arrived at 4 pm a little late as we were back and getting ready for the evening. Parking is $40+ a day, steep even from an east coast perspective.

ReviewText:This is a place to sleep, rooms are clean, but is too dated, the floor carpet had multiple stains and it makes look the room a bit nasty. It's really well located, 7 blocks/union square. Personal is awesome specialliy Maria, she is great. Breakfast is free and is good (eggs, beagles, bread, muffins, coffe, yogurt, juices, multiple fruits) also free wi-fi. Personally I think this is a good option.

ReviewText:The rooms were small and there were some dodgy neighborhoods you wouldn't want to walk around in late at night just to the west of the hotel, but the free breakfast and Wi-Fi in the hotel were great. The hotel was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. It is also one of the most affordable hotels in the heart of San Francisco.
