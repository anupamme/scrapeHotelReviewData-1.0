review: We spent three nights at this hotel in September 2014. We upgraded to a "unique" suite on site and were very happy we did so. It was a beautifully appointed room, and a wonderful place to retreat after a day of touring. The hotel is located within a few minutes of restaurants and the main sights (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Palace, Cistern, Hamman, Grand Bazaar). The service at this hotel is exceptional. The breakfast buffet was good. We did not dine at the hotel, opting to try the restaurants only a block away. When we return to Istanbul, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.
