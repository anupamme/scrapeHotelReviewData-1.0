review: We recently spent 4 nights in Istanbul at the Neorion Hotel. We were greeted with a brief orientation on the sites and transportation systems around Istanbul, a refreshing drink, and a light afternoon buffet (mezze) which included soup, sandwiches, fruit, vegetables, and bread. After a long flight, it was wonderful not to have to try to find a place to eat when all we wanted was a light snack and a comfortable bed. Not only was the bed comfortable, the room immaculate, but we were welcomed with a nice bottle of wine, a tray of nuts, figs, raisins, and, of course, Turkish delight. The hotel is conveniently located a short distance from the ferry and a tram station you can take to the major sites around town. You will find the entire staff very helpful and friendly. Upon leaving, we received a farewell letter and a thoughtful parting gift. This is a top notch hotel and one you will certainly want to include in any trip to Istanbul.
