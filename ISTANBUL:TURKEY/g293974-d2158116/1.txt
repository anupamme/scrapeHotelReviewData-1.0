review: Amazingly friendly hotel, super pool, sauna, Hamman, fantastic rooftop area. Free daily meze and glass of wine. The staff couldn't do enough to help. When it rained there were enough umbrellas for everyone. Rooms and bathrooms extremely clean and well appointed. Blue Mosque and other sites just around the corner from the hotel. Tram runs along the bottom of the road. Will definitely be going back. Room Tip: Doesn't matter if room overlooks busy road, double glazed windows cut all traffic sound out. All... See more room tips
