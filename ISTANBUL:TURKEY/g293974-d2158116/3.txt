review: We just spent a long weekend in Istanbul for my birthday with our two kids. I can only confirm what I read in other reviews: the hotel is small, perfectly located in the old town ( which of course means you hear the calls to prayers but for us it was no issue) with great facilities and really friendly staff that goes the extra mile to make you feel at home... My favourite thing was probably the rooftop terrasse, not to mention you get free drinks and food 6-7pm every night. They organized a surprise cake for my birthday without being asked and were wonderful with the kids. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul who wishes to be located in a central spot in the old town walking distance to Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, grand bazaar and many other worthwhile sites. Many cafÃ©s and shops at your doorsteps too. Thank you to the staff for making our stay extra special Raffaella Switzerland
