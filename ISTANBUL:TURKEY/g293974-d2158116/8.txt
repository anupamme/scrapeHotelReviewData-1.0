title: Neorion Hotel is Great
rating: 5 of 5 stars
Date: 30 September 2014
review: I was insistent with my travel agent about staying at the Neorion after reading all the great reviews here on TA and I was not disappointed. The location was perfect, the staff fantastic, the room was very clean. The rooftop bar was amazing - nothing like watching the sunset looking out over Old Town with an ice cold beer in hand. Thank you to everyone at the hotel. Room Tip: The quiet rooms are at the back of the hotel. See more room tips
