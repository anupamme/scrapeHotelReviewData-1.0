review: We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and everything was perfect. Great personal sevices, really nice rooms, spotlessy clean. Perfect location with walking distance to all major tourist attractions. Beatutiful spa with hamam - we had great "turkish scrub" treatment. This must be the best hotel to stay on when visiting Istanbul.
