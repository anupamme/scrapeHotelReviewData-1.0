review: It's all been said & well. We spent 5 nights and were truly treated as 'misafir' guests of the home. From the friendly efficient check in - lots of information with clear maps, the wonderful sunset drink on the patio with the incredible views, very clean rooms and common spaces, variety of breakfast choices, the mezzes throughout the day and the most gracious staff. They really did make an effort to make you feel comfortable and welcome. Our stay included airport pick up which was great - traffic is wild. Also organized trip back to airport for reasonable rate. The location is great for all the sites and tons of restaurants. Bit noisy at night & early morning but not unmanageable & yes earplugs are provided. Have and will continue to recommend. Room Tip: Rooms higher up are nice. No real views from any that we could tell. See more room tips
