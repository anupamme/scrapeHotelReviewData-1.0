review: For our long weekend trip to Istanbul we chose to stay in Neorion hotel in the Old City. Before had checked many hotels and driven by the enormously positive reviews on trip advisor we decided on Neorion. Best choice by far! Location is very convenient for easy access to all historic icons of the City. It takes literally 10 to 20 minutes to walk to Aya Sofiya or Blue Mosque and Basilica Cistern or The Grand Bazaar. Hotel itself is pretty modern and decorated very tastefully. It is usually not easy to achieve the right ambience together with comfortability but Neorion managed that beautifully! The room was very comfortable & pleasant. Bathroom facilities top notch. The lobby again very comfortable and nicely decorated with replicas of Byzantine artefacts on display. In the background nice music adding to the relaxing feel. There is a spa in the hotel, where guests can enjoy all the treatments. Staff and their service alleviates this hotel to a different level. All of them are very professional, speaking flawless English, attentive yet not over keen. Making reservations, whether at a restaurant or hammam was not a problem at all! Can't praise the hotel enough and have seen quite a few in my travels. Recommended to all discerning travellers seeking good quality and pleasant accommodation in the great city of Istanbul!
