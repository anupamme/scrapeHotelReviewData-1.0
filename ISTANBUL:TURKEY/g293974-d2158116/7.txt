review: This hotel is a gem! The staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and acquainted with both the hotel and the entire city. We were only staying there for two nights on our honeymoon and they treated us the same way that I would imagine being treated if you were staying for a week. The rooms, common areas and facilities are very clean and nicely decorated. We loved the view from the rooftop terrace (it looks exactly like the pictures on their website in real life) and enjoyed the free glass of wine they gave us during sunset. While we didn't use them, the pool and spa were beautiful and seemed quite relaxing. The location of the hotel is superb- within a short walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and all of the major sites. It is very well situated in the heart of everything. The front desk staff were so kind and called to arrange a taxi over to our next destination for us. If you are looking for a place to stay in the old city- look no further. This hotel has an exceptional staff, great location and lovely, clean rooms. Truly great value!
