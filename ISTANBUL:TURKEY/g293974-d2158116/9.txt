title: Great place to stay in Istanbul
rating: 5 of 5 stars
Date: 29 September 2014
review: 5 star service in Istanbul - this very comfortable hotel is perfectly situated in Istanbul - you can walk to all the major sites and great restaurants. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the breakfast delicious. The rooftop terrace is a bonus for having some down time and enjoying a great view. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Room Tip: I opted for a room on 5th or 6th floor to avoid road noise. See more room tips
