review: I read all the reviews before going to Istanbul on this hotel and was a bit sceptic that it nearly got 100% on all elements. But let me tell you it was amazing. Friendly helpful staff. Amazing air conditioned spacious room. Free mini bar and generous buffet breakfast. The location could not be closer to all the best "attractions". Would highly recommend it!!!!! anonymous South Africa
