review: Just finished our holiday in Istanbul with a week at the Millennium Suites and couldn't have been happier and Celal the Manager was just so helpful and welcoming.. Firstly, the location is fantastic situated in a beautiful cobbled street within easy walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Grand Bazar, Spice Bizzar and all the must see attractions. Secondly, The Suites are all large and beautifully appointed with views over the street or the back of the property, all rooms are great we stayed in 302 which was beautiful. The rooms come with complementary mini-bar just what you need after a day exploring this beautiful city. Each morning breakfast is provided in the lobby and cafe style sidewalk dining area, the food was delicious with a great variety of fruit, sweets, breads, hot dishes and eggs any way you like. Finally, the staff were wonderful their advice and attention to detail was great, this is a family run establishment that prides itself on customer service and a genuine desire to make your stay special. Thanks Celal and staff we had an amazing week with you and will always remember our stay as a highlight of our trip. Room Tip: All rooms are fantastic but remember no lift so if your knees aren't great opt for a lower floor... See more room tips
