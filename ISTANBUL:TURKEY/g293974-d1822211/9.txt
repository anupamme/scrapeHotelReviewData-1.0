title: Istanbul at its best!
rating: 5 of 5 stars
Date: 1 September 2014
review: This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!
