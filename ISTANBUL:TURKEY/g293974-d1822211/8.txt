review: My husband and I just stayed at millennium suites for the first stop on our honeymoon! It was absolutely fantastic... We highly recommend this boutique hotel. Amazing service, GREAT staff, soooo clean, fabulous location! We will definitely be back. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best it could be!!!! It was absolutely amazing... We loved it...
