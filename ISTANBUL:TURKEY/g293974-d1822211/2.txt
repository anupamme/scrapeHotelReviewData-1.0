review: We have traveled all over the world and have stayed in some of the finest hotels around and we have to say that our expectations were far exceeded. The team at the Millennium Suites were there to make us feel at home and we did. Our room was large and well done and the amenities were excellent. We spent four nights at the Millennium Suites. While we were there my wife had a birthday, and I mentioned it at breakfast. With in minutes, and unexpectedly, the hotel presented her with a birthday cake and song. There was enough cake to share with the others at breakfast, as well as with the hotel staff. Everyday we received great directions and suggestions for places to go. Every evening a cold beer was waiting for us on our return. It was a great place and time. Istanbul was fun, too.
