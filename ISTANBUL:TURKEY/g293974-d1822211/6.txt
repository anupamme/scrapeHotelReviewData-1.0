rating: 3 of 5 stars
Date: 6 September 2014
review: We only stayed three nights. Location was perfect,, 200 yards from blue mosque and in the heart of old istanbul, restuarants and night life galore. Room was adequate. Old furnishings,,, something like a bedroom at your grandmothers house. Bathroom was very small and shower didnt drain. Staff was very pleasant.
