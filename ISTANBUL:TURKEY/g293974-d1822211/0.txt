review: Extremely friendly staff, great room (best bed we encountered in a month of travelling), outstanding breakfast, a location that cannot be surpassed (within two blocks of the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace), clean, superb service, compact elegance You cannot go wrong with the Millenium Suites. The staff make the place, from the young woman who worked over an hour on the computer and in consultation with Turkish Airlines reservation people to obtain boarding passes and seat assignments for us on ourflight to Montreal, to the young man, a perfectionist, who made sure that we had a good touring day despite the rain (it was great thanks to him), another young man who provided so much valuable guidance on what to do and when to do it. But every other aspect of the hotel is exceptional also. We would not stay anywhere else. Room Tip: If you cannot walk up a flight of steps request a room on the ground floor. See more room tips
