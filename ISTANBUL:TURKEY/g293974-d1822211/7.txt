review: We were 4 couples from Australia and spent 4 wonderful nights at the Millennium. the rooms were an absolute treat to come back to each day and there was nothing the staff would not do to help us. Would not hesitate going back to the hotel and will be recommending it to anyone traveling to Istanbul. We all agreed the high rating it receives is more than deserved. A real gem.
