review: My husband and I stayed at the Amira for 2 nights after our Oceania cruise. From the moment the taxi pulled up outside the hotel to the moment we left we could not have asked for better service. We were made to feel so welcome and were offered a complimentary breakfast upon our early arrival. The hotel was perfectly situated for sightseeing and literally minutes away from the Blue Mosque. We were able to walk out of the hotel to most of major sights which was a real plus for us. The hotel was an oasis of calm after the hustle and bustle of the city, especially the amazing roof terrace. Our room was very spacious and comfortable with extra luxuries such as gowns and slippers. I cannot fault the hotel at all. I wished we had booked 3 nights post cruise instead of the 2. We are cruising from Istanbul again and would not want to stay anywhere else but at the Amira. Cannot wait to go back. Room Tip: We had a room on the top floor and It was the only room at the top of the stairs. There was no lift... See more room tips
