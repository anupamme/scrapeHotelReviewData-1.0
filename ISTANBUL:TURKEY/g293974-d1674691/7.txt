rating: 5 of 5 stars

review: Located on the European side, Hotel Amira was delightful place to stay & we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else on our return visits. The staff were very friendly & most helpful in assisting us finding the great restaurants, all within walking distance. Try 'Fine Dine' Istanbul and Moustafa Sea Food, both outstanding and not expensive.. Amira also arranged boat tours and a personal guide to take us to all the sightsâ¦ We didn't have to line up for the 'hot spots'. Breakfast & afternoon tea were outstanding, both tasty & a work of artistry. Amira's roof-top terrace provided a spectacular view of the Bosphorus & glorious sunsets. Service, cleanliness and attention to detail were superb. My song while we were there was 'Happy'... Room Tip: Room 701 was large, plenty of windows for natural light & a large private balcony.
