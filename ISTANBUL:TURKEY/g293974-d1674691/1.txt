review: We were sad to leave this wonderful hotel after 4 fantastic days. Our rooms were spacious and comfortable with everything we could require. The breakfast and afternoon tea both included in the rate offered a wonderful array of choices in a charming environment. Each evening we headed to the upstairs rooftop terrace to enjoy sundowners and a great view. All the major landmarks are within easy walking distance of the hotel. The staff were truly wonderful and all were so helpful and charming. A big thank you to all of them but especially to Karin Toker who gave so generously of her time to make this such a special experience for the four of us.
