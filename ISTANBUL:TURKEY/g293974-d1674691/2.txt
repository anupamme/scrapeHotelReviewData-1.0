review: We stayed here overnight ahead of a cruise out of Istanbul and although only one night, we were made to feel very welcome. Lots of advice on the location, maps, guidance on where to run etc. The staff were extremely helpful at all times. Offer drinks whilst we were waiting to leave and nothing was too much trouble. Good wifi, nice terrace on roof, big breakfast choice including lots of local items too. Very close to all the main sites (just 5 mins walk to Blue Mosque) Stayed again on the way back -see other review
