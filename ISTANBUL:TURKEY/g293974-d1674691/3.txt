review: I had a Birthday Reunion in Istanbul. We stayed at the Sumahan but my dear Friends who came before us and had to leave also before as they had a date with friends in Italy stayed at the Amira. They loved it, the owner was adorable and laid the proverbial Red Carpet for them. I went to visit them, met the owner and had tea on the terrace. Amazing view, good service. My friends who are world travellers like their room, comfortable and clean. I always stay at the Sumahan when in Istabul but if I had guests who wanted to visit exclusively the Old Town I would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Amira.
