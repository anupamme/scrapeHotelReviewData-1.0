title: Hotel Amira- a gem in Istanbul
rating: 5 of 5 stars
Date: 30 September 2014
review: Hotel Amira is a gem of a hotel. The Hotel Amira is centrally located, clean, nice, and reasonably priced. We only stay in 4 star or better hotels so you can trust us when we say that this hotel is nice. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I would stay here again. Both the breakfast and 4:00 tea time were great. .
