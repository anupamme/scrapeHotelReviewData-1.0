review: Service, service, and more service! This small hotel is well located to walk to most major attractions in Istanbul, and stands out because of the service they provide their guests. We all are treated like royalty for the days we are in their care. AJ, the concierge was most helpful in helping us decide where to visit, where to eat, and what Turkish bath to enjoy. Not one choice was a bad one for us. Their afternoon tea was a delight, and a great way to spend an hour after pounding the pavement in search of bargains at the Grand bazzar or the Spice market. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Istanbul. 4-1/2 Stars.
