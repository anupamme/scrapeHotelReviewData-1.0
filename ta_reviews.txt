Hotel Drisco, San Francisco Hotel Drisco	Reviewed 2 weeks ago	5 of 5 stars	Even the most understated room is a great room here. It is very comfortable, clean and there is attention to detail and service. For what you get the price is reasonable. The breakfast which was included was very tasty. Dear Sheryl T,
We take great pride in outfitting even our smallest rooms with all of the wonderful amenities as in our largest suites! Of course with a suite you get a lot more space and our "City View" rooms provide dramatic views of San Francisco. Thanks so much for your review!

Hotel Drisco, San Francisco Hotel Drisco	Reviewed 2 weeks ago	5 of 5 stars	Even the most understated room is a great room here. It is very comfortable, clean and there is attention to detail and service. For what you get the price is reasonable. The breakfast which was included was very tasty. Dear Sheryl T,
We take great pride in outfitting even our smallest rooms with all of the wonderful amenities as in our largest suites! Of course with a suite you get a lot more space and our "City View" rooms provide dramatic views of San Francisco. Thanks so much for your review!
Kind Regards,

Hotel Drisco, San Francisco Hotel Drisco	Reviewed 2 weeks ago	5 of 5 stars	We stayed at Hotel Drisco for one night during our honeymoon. What a gem! Ideally located on top of one of San Francisco's many hills, you have views down on each side to the water. Check-in was a breeze, and the employees are very dutiful and responsive. We had checked in late and apparently just missed a wine tasting, so... More Dear Sukoh,
Thanks for noticing all of the "little touches" that we love to provide, from the Nespresso machine to the tiny bag of amenities we hang our your door the morning of departure.

Chancellor Hotel on Union Square, San Francisco Chancellor Hotel on Union Square	Reviewed 6 days ago NEW	5 of 5 stars	My husband and I stayed in room 1401 at the Chancellor this past weekend, and we couldn't have been more pleased.

Chancellor Hotel on Union Square, San Francisco Chancellor Hotel on Union Square	Reviewed yesterday NEW	4 of 5 stars	The best quality of this hotel is its location.
