InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-06-30	5	Perfect location. Walking distance to union square. Plenty of restaurants and bars around. Easy to get to all attractions in San Francisco....staff was so accommodating. The entire hotel including the rooms were in great condition. Had an old feel but very updated.

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-04-26	2	The room was very clean and pretty comfortable, but the prices were a little out there. You had to pay for parking and wifi. We were not greeted as much as the older customers. I would have liked a better located hotel. There were too many cable car rides, which took up lots of precious vacation time. It was a fun experience to ride them, but I think I would have liked something closer to the piers because we went there almost every night. Waiting late at night in the cold for a cable car or street car was not fun.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-03-10	5	The staff at Mark Hopkins was extremely friendly, helpful and professional. The valets greeted myself and my friend in the parking lot immediately, the bell hop safely stored our luggage after checkout (we were in a class all day) people at the front desk were helpful, housekeepers always had a smile and acknowledged us each and every time we saw them in the hall. The food was good also. I don't have any complaints at all and I would highly recommend this place.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-02-20	4	The Mark Hopkins is a San Francisco classic, on Nob Hill, with a great view, very elegant. Our only complaint was that we left shoes to be shined overnight and they rang our doorbell, twice, at 7:00AM rather than just leaving them, as they said they would do.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-01-20	1	Let me start by saying that I've NEVER written a bad review in all my years of traveling the world - including my job producing and directing for The Travel Channel & Discovery. The Intercontinental Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco left me stranded at the waterfront wharf at 11pm at night when I told them I was alone and afraid and needed their help. They refused to call me a cab stating it was against their policy. the hotel refused to call me a cab saying it was against their policy! I told them I was alone at the wharf . The hotel said they couldn't call me a cab but they could give me a number. I said I didn't have a pen to write it down and that it was dark and desolate needed their help and they said, "that's our policy, sorry, call back if you want a cab number" and then hung up on me! I called them back to get number and beg at this point for them to help me by calling a cab for me - a female guest alone and somewhat upset at this point - they rattled off number which I forgot and when I called back - they rattled it off and hung up again.I'm a New Yorker and comfortable in any situation but this was crazy and I want to warn other female guests and have the Intercontinental change their policy. I asked the Fairmont hotel across the street the next day that if a guest called in for a cab from outside location and the concierge was of course they would!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2014-01-01	5	The Mark Hopkins is truly a first class hotel with all of the first lass perks: views, staff, food, and location.

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-12-26	4	We were pleased with the accommodations and the complimentary access to the Top of the Mark. However, the Christmas display next door at the Fairmount put the Mark Hopkins lobby to shame.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-12-05	5	We arrived and the type of room we chose was not available. The front desk person was kind enough to upgrade us to a corner room in the next grade up. Everyone was wonderful. The only drawback I can even mention is that it's 59.00 to park your car. You might want to make other arrangements. :)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-06-26	4	We had a wonderful stay at the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins. Fabulous location, friendly and attentive staff and an excellent room for the price we paid. The only thing missing here are amenities such as a gift shop for those forgotten essentials and a pool. Given the historic nature of the property the lack of the pool is understandable. The Fairmont next door has a gift shop but it would be nice not to have to dash across the street. Other than that, great experience here and would certainly stay again!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-06-21	4	Very, very clean and neat. Staff was great with directions and assistance. Booked our city tour and things went off without a hitch.

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-04-03	5	Great location! Cable car stops nearby. The Top of the Mark bar at the top of the hotel has a great view of the city.

InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-03-25	4	We paid $162 per night, which is a great deal for San Francisco. (Beware of those $110 to $130 SF hotels, research the location & read reviews before booking). Parking was expensive, about $58 per night. I'm not sure what the average price for overnight parking is in the area - you might be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. -newline- The hotel was nice: beautiful lobby, clean rooms. The view from The Top of the Mark is amazing. The waiters were a bit slow, but everyone was friendly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>
InterContinental MARK HOPKINS SAN FRANCISCO		2013-03-15	4	The InterContinental Mark Hopkins at Nob Hill is a stately, elegant hotel with great service, classic appointments, a "peak" location, and fantasticly comfortable beds. -newline-  -newline- Some parts of the hotel are a little tired #I'm always a little grossed out by scarred woodwork that's been repainted over and over - but this IS an older hotel so it's really not indicative of anything untoward...# and I wish these folks would provide free wifi. On the other hand, the free coffee in the lobby in the morning is a nice perk.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">999 California Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

Morning of checkout, noticed a $62 parking charge on the room invoice. They quickly cleared this at the front desk, though they did ask to see my confirmation email on my phone. -newline-  -newline- You'd think 0rbitz & the hotel would have better integration.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">345 Stockton St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

Grand Hyatt San Francisco on Union Square		2013-10-02	4	Had an amazing time in San Francisco, largely due to our stay at the Grand Hyatt. -newline- The staff is wonderful. From the moment we got the the curb to the moment they booked us a ride to the airport. -newline-  -newline- Definitely the most professional and friendly valet staff I’ve ever come across. Each time you head for the front door they open it. They take great care of your vehicle, the parking garage they use is right across the street, they just have to drive around the block to park. Anything you need they’ll take care of it. -newline- Front desk staff was wonderful. They hooked us up with some cupcakes and other offerings because it was my mother-in-laws birthday. -newline- The concierge were very helpful and even the housekeeping staff seemed energetic. -newline- 4 stars because there was some trash left in the window track behind the curtains, the room was pretty clean, the pillowcases, pillows and beds could use an upgrade already. The mattress was fairly comfy but too soft for a large person and not very supportive. Mattress was also showing the classic “dip” in the middle. -newline- So, the room could’ve been cleaner, the beds should be of better quality, and pillows could use and upgrade, but nothing is perfect. -newline- Staff was excellent, great location basically right on Union Square (around the corner). Stayed in 7 different hotels/B&B's in SF and the Grand Hyatt presented us the best staff, location and service. -newline- Would stay here again for sure	<span itemprop="streetAddress">345 Stockton St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

Below are summary points of my experience: -newline- * Bed and pillows extremely comfortable -newline- * Work out are was tight but great views -newline- * Valet was expensive and a little odd that there was no place to drive in to avoid street trafic and you competed with cabs - for less money you could park accross the street but less convenient -newline- * front desk was confusing due to stations that you walk up to instead of traditional front desk location -newline- * Location to Union square was excellent	<span itemprop="streetAddress">345 Stockton St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

It's right next to Union Square and a short walk to the Westfield Mall (with plenty of shops along the way to the mall). -newline-  -newline- There's more restaurants within a 5 minute walk than you could eat at in a month - and they are all fantastic. -newline-  -newline- The staff was very helpful - the concierges always pointed us in the right direction for shops, food, etc. -newline-  -newline- The only issue I had were the pillows (I prefer cotton vs. down pillows), but I didn't have the time to ask for cotton pillows (which they probably would have given me).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">345 Stockton St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

I had a breakfast date with a friend one morning but went to the hotel in-house first because the food is divine, then just had coffee with my friend later.

Our room came with free breakfast, which was the breakfast buffet. Food was excellent- several meat options, eggs, fruit, cheese, bread/ pastries, yogurt, oatmeal. Wait staff were excellent- always there to refill your coffee or juice. Location convenient to all shopping stores. we were on the 14th floor- could hear street noise saturday night/ early sun morning- (however, beyond hotels control). i would stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">345 Stockton St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

Grand Hyatt San Francisco on Union Square		2012-07-26	5	Stayed two nights for pleasure. Room is great. No real view but panoramic and nice. Quiet end room. Only used room service which was good. Don't know if its their restaurant food, which I read terribly reviews on but ours was fine and dessert really good. Nice size. Excellent location convenient to Union Square, financial district, walkable to bus train subway cable cars... price is good for the area, great value for the area. Oh and they were booked but allowed us free late checkout. Front door guys are awesome and go out of their way for you, held our luggage while we walked around after checkout. Counter people were friendly as well. Limo/taxi front door service.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">345 Stockton St, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94108</span>

San Francisco Marriott Marquis		2014-08-10	5	This was not a planned trip but for the price I got more than I expected. This Marriott is kinda hidden amongst the other fancy hotels downtown but the folk there made the most of it. Personable and helpful. Located next to a wonderful mall and the Street Car line I enjoyed the personal attention and felt Safe as well. Availability of Transportation and food was excellent. Might just hang out here again by myself just for the fun of it. I really felt like i was at home away from home.

San Francisco Marriott Marquis		2014-06-30	3	This is an average highrise hotel surrounded by other average highrise hotels in an excellent location on Mission and 4th. My husband and I were in SF for Pride, and the location really is fantastic. We fit us and our 3 kids into one comfortable room and were not unexpectedly cramped. Unfortunately upon checking in our bathroom sink didn't drain and it took the hotel 2 days to repair it. A day and a half to respond to the problem, and a few hours of repair work. It was also pretty poor form to turn over the room starting at 1400, only to proceed at a glacial pace. It took two people an hour to make the beds and vacuum.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">780 Mission Street, 780 Mission Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>
San Francisco Marriott Marquis		2014-06-22	4	Visited, accompanied by my son and daughter-in-law, to spend time with family members from Singapore who were staying in SFO. Marriott's central location made for ease in traveling to them as well as to Muir Woods, California Jewish Museum (within walking distance), and other locales on our list. Hotel staff was most accommodating, arranging for food to be delivered to my room even after the posted room service hours, and to providing me with and storing a wheelchair for me during my stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">780 Mission Street, 780 Mission Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>

San Francisco Marriott Marquis		2014-01-05	4	We were in this hotel from Dec 25 -31, 2013. It was great location and good hotel. Only complain is that I can not find anything in the room that stating they would charge the bottle water on the desk, not in the small frig. We used two of them, that cost us ~$20 at check out. That is little too deceptive and too much of a charge!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">780 Mission Street, 780 Mission Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>

The pool is very nice, and the gym is small, but effective. The beds in our room was ridiculously comfortable. They have a restaurant downstairs which is glamorous to say the least. They have a $85 Saturday brunch, which is well worth the money. -newline-  -newline- We decided to splurge a little to get this hotel, and it was well worth the money.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2014-05-04	4	The hotel is in a good location and has a very "old, classy SF" feel to it. I've stayed here a couple of times with no issues, but this last time was a bit of a disappointment. There was no TP (only the roll that was there when we go to the room). We could also hear the guests in the next room in the morning. Lastly, the parking situation was a bit confusing-if you valet its a lot more versus parking in the garage (across the street) yourself.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2014-04-24	4	I really like beds and amenities in this hotel. In fact I always stay there when I travel to San Francisco.

Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2013-12-26	1	Let me start with saying that I until 48 hours ago, I have never stayed in a four-star hotel. I've mostly stayed at local motels or hostels. I wanted to get out town for the day and see the sights with my boyfriend; we've had a rough year and I figured it would be a nice treat for us to stay somewhere nice. -newline-  -newline- When we first checked in, everything was fine. The gentleman assisting us was friendly and professional; it was only when he attempted to bill my card $200 for an "incidentals" deposit that we began to have problems. He didn't even tell me what he was doing beforehand- every step of the way, he explained what he was doing until the end [which, in hindsight, is also weird]. I explained to him that we are low-income, and that we had only brought $100 in spending money for the trip. I mentioned that I did not recollect any mention of a deposit on the hotel's page or on my confirmation. -newline-  -newline- He became very rude and sneered at me with, "In EVERY hotel in EVERY part of the world, you will have to pay a deposit." A bit taken aback, I asked him to clarify what "incidentals" were, and if we could simply remove them from our room so we would not have to pay for them. He said they could- but I'd still have to pay the deposit for them. Which made absolutely NO sense to me. He said he could make an exception for me and "only" charge me $100. Again, I paid $100 for items that have been disabled in my room- room service, restaurant tab, laundry services, movies, etc. -newline-  -newline- At this point, I was feeling the desperation sink in and tried to explain the situation again. He basically told me if I didn't pay what I had, I couldn't get our room- and I would not be refunded the booking fee. The look he gave me made me feel so humiliated; like I'm not a valued "elegant guest" because I don't have a ton of money. At this point, I was crying; I gave him the money and we went upstairs. -newline-  -newline- In additon to some of the other patrons being INCREDIBLY rude [several women pushed my boyfriend aside to get in the elevator multiple times], the basic amnities that you would find elsewhere re unavailable here- or impossible to find, like the ice machine. Some of the lights did not work in the bathroom, there were open holes in the wall from where fixtures had been moved, and there was only one outlet for us to charge our phones- it was in the doorway of our room. -newline-  -newline- The one good thing about our room was the bed. I've never slept in a bed that soft; it was probably one of the best night's sleep I've had in a long, long time. -newline-  -newline- When we checked out, our clerk this time was much nicer, and everyone was super sweet- a total 180 from the previous day. We were promptly refunded our deposit, and gladly spent our money elsewhere. -newline-  -newline- I will come back to check out their holiday displays during Christmastime, but I will NEVER, EVER stay here again. Any "luxury" hotel that is so unaccomodating and rude to paying guests needs an overhaul.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2013-12-02	5	The Palace is reminiscent of the grand hotels of the last century where elegance, exquisite architecture and polite, attentive staff was the norm.

The exercise and pool facilities are a highlight as was the beautiful decor and dining room. -newline-  -newline- Overall, the hotel is pricey, but I was lucky to get a deal online ($143/night).

We used the BART system to ride into the city, and the hotel is located mere steps away from the Montgomery Street BART entrance, making the trip very easy. Check in was a breeze, and our room was well appointed with luxury bath products, complimentary bottled waters, and a comfy bed. My boyfriend struggles with chronic back pain and has a hard time sleeping because of it, but he slept like a rock on their mattress! It was wonderful! -newline-  -newline- We were disappointed not to be able to have time to take a dip in the beautiful pool, but managed to have a drink at the Palace's Pied Piper bar and loved the old photographs showing the hotels historic past and famous visitors! -newline-  -newline- Over all we had a wonderful stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>

Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2012-11-19	3	Beautiful, historic building. Wonderful location. Check in slow due to only having one staff person, but she was very good. Nice room, but no in-room coffee. Food in restaurant WAY over-priced ( had a conversation in the elevator with a couple carrying McDonald's breakfast about $12 bacon and eggs and $6.50 coffee). And in the 21st century, having to pay for in-room wi-fi is a problem.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2012-06-27	4	The Palace Hotel is a good value. Significantly cheaper nightly rate than most of the other 4 star hotels in the financial district. Clean rooms, great service. The atrium restaurant is beautiful and the bar is great. Its an old hotel (+/-150 years?), but that adds character and prestige, not a detriment -- long history of many past presidents and heads of state have stayed there. Highly recommend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>

Palace Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San Francisco		2012-02-28	4	Location: walking distance to wharf or Little Italy (long walk, but that is SF), financial district and Union Square. Clean, nice area of town. -newline-  -newline- Staff: Very nice, professional staff. Definitely attempt to maintain a European atmosphere. We are a younger couple, but staff treated us as well as the typically older clientele. -newline-  -newline- Atmosphere: Very nice- but definitely a historical, antique style. Seems to aim for French-bourgeoisie/provincial style. Starwood Property so there is a strong brand behind the hotel- plus you can earn points. -newline-  -newline- Room: Clean and sufficient. Not "modern", but rooms have been updated. Definitely a nice, well maintained property (did not feel "old" like other SF hotels). We were in a basic, King bedroom. Had a fridge- always a plus after Little Italy pizza!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2 New Montgomery Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>

Hotel Griffon		2014-08-15	3	We came here for one night to attend an Outside Lands concert. Hotels during this time was extremely expensive so I was happy to find anything for less than $300. (I understand that at non-peak times that hotel would be considered affordable.) -newline-  -newline- Breakdown: -newline- Room: it was small, would only fit two small adults but the bed was comfy. -newline- View: The room we were in had no view (actually view of the fire escape). -newline- Front desk: they were wonderful and helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Steuart Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>
Hotel Griffon		2014-08-12	4	Good location, near many restaurants, near Embarcadero and movies. Friendly staff, Perry's has good food.

Hotel Griffon		2014-08-12	3	This Hotel should be selected for the location. The room we were assigned #408 was below average at best. There is a club of some sort which goes on pretty late on Saturday nights. Staff was A++.

Hotel Griffon		2014-08-11	3	My husband and I walk extensively in San Francisco and the location of the hotel is perfect for this. The staff were very friendly and accomadating. The room had every necessity, which functioned well,but was tiny, so good for sleeping , not lounging. It's an old building and therefore musty smelling, and the ventilation was insufficient. That being said, would stay again as an overnight in the future as it is a good value	<span itemprop="streetAddress">155 Steuart Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94105</span>

Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2013-04-03	5	I have never been to San Francisco, CA, therefore I had no clue what to expect of the hotel or the location, other than it being located Downtown. This was the "BEST" hotel I have stayed at in a very long time. The rooms were MAGNIFICENT. The decor was DYNAMIC. The staff was WONDERFUL. My fiance had a great time during his surprise getaway birthday weekend and thought the hotel was very classy and upscale. We will return!!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 Geary Street, 550 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2013-04-03	4	Overall a very good hotel. The location is great -it's 3 blocks from Union Square -the centre of San Francisco. -newline- The funky, over-the-top decor of the reception area and the staff are what really makes this place. There is a cool bar on the ground floor next to the reception area. As for rooms - ours was a good size with two large double beds and a bright crisp decor. One observation, although the hotel has been renovated, it feels like a part re-furb as opposed to a total re-furb. By which I mean all rooms are repainted, but I'd like to have seen them take the walls back to original state then re-plaster and re-paint, as opposed to painting over the previous decor. It's a minor point and really does not affect the quality of your stay - just an aesthetic. As for those people who have commented about the area I'd just say - Get real have you never been to a city before? Yes there are some homeless people in the area - as there are in all areas of a major city. It feels safe and does not detract from the overall experience.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 Geary Street, 550 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2013-04-01	4	Had a very good stay here - just a couple of blocks from Union Square. Lots of nice restaurants nearby, and a short walk to BART, etc. -newline- The room was very nice, clean, and comfortable. Internet was $9.95/day. Not end of the world, but I instead went to a nearby cafe with free wireless. Overall, a nice, clean place that seems to have been recently remodelled.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 Geary Street, 550 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2013-03-06	4	Service was very attentive. Only problem was that I had expensive valet parking (discounted $39 per night) and when I checked out the bellman forgot to give me my car key fob. I would have noticed right away but my wife had her fob in her purse and the car started up. I didn't miss the fob until I stopped for food a hundred miles away. I called the hotel and they found the key fob and sent it to me overnight mail. The hotel has been remodeled and some rooms are still being worked on. I never saw the balcony shown in the pictures.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 Geary Street, 550 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2013-02-25	4	The location of this hotel is excellent. Two blocks from Union square and surrounded by galleries and theaters. Nice staff and clean.

Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2013-02-20	3	It looks good but there are details that could complicate your stay. -newline- Internet. I paid $9.99 a day and it was extremely slow. As I understood later, router was without an adapter (was off) and I took internet from other rooms. It was fixed during 12 hours (!):)) -newline- It is just a detail now but it was very important that day	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 Geary Street, 550 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection		2012-12-31	3	I have a small paranoia of bugs and cleanliness when I stay in places that I do not know. I did the usual checks and found no signs of bed bugs for those that are paranoid as well. -newline-  -newline- Pros - The rooms were mostly clean, it was freshly vacuumed and new sheets were put on. The colors were very welcoming and made the room feel very homey. -newline-  -newline- Cons - There was some moisture mold on the window sill behind the desk. Probably one of the more neglected areas because of its location. The bathroom was satisfactory. The shower looked like a normal tub and even had some of the porcelain coming off in areas. Definitely not as nice as if could have been. -newline-  -newline- Overall a nice stay with some little details that need to be looked at by the staff. I will most likely not be staying here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 Geary Street, 550 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Nob Hill Hotel		2014-07-27	3	If you're just looking for an inexpensive-ish place to stay near Union Square, you've found it.

Nob Hill Hotel		2014-07-19	1	This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in on a business trip, and that's saying a lot.

Nob Hill Hotel		2014-07-07	2	I booked a room at this hotel for three days after viewing the photographs of the rooms etc on line. It looked somewhat European and different, which I liked. -newline- On arriving at the hotel late at night my wife and I were given a room that was no bigger then a cupboard. Certainly not at all good accommodation for two people. The metal bed head and bottom board were broken the wash hand basin was in the bedroom and not in the bathroom, The room paintwork was chipped the bedside chair was broken and disgusting as no one would want to sit on it. We checked the bed linen as I was expecting the worse. As it was late we slept in the room, all night the hot water pipes rattled and kept us awake. In the morning I asked for a room change and got it. Thankfully the room was a whole lot better. -newline- I had to pay $30 a day to have the car parked on the last day, Saturday we had to wait over an hour to get the car returned to us. If this is a problem for the hotel as it obviously is, then don't offer the valet service? -newline- I would say to anyone booking this hotel before you pay for the hotel room if at all possible view the room first? If anyone had been given the room I had on check-in you would be definitely insulted. I would suggest to the hotel management to get a painter and decorator in as ]the rooms need a huge clean-up. As for the horrible small cupboard rooms...these are for brooms and mops only and should not be used for paying guests.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">835 Hyde Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>

Nob Hill Hotel		2014-06-01	3	This hotel was fine, clean easy to get to But… it borders some not so nice neighborhoods in SF that you should be aware of - the tenderloin district. I can't believe with all the money in SF - they can't clean up both tenderloin and mission districts. Its appalling - quite honestly I don't see the appeal to SF - expensive, dirty and not very friendly.- Certainly this particular part was not the fault of the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">835 Hyde Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94109</span>

Monaco San Francisco, a Kimpton Hotel		2014-01-09	5	People anywhere make or break the experience and the staff at Kimpton Monaco Hotel is absolutely the best! They really care about their guests. Excellent stay at a wonderful hotel. Our room was super clean, comfortable and quiet. Bed and comforter were very comfortable. Coffee in the mornings and wine from 5-6 was a plus.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">501 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Monaco San Francisco, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-11-27	2	Disappointed by the concierge. We wanted to go to Gary Danko for our anniversary dinner. We we discouraged to go because we were told there was a ten month waiting list. So we decided to go somewhere else. When we got back to the hotel after our dinner, another couple was talking to the concierge about how great her recommendation was to go to Gary Danko for dinner that night. Just blew my mind why she would recommend a restaurant to someone else and not to us..... I would not recommend this place. The best service we received were from the door men they were prompt and respectful. -newline-  -newline- As far as location, you cannot walk and explore the surrounding area especially at night to the west or south of the hotel. Very dangerous. -newline-  -newline- Local phone call is not free in the hotel. They will charge you.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">501 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Monaco San Francisco, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-10-24	4	The room decor was somewhat jangling rather than soothing, although the bed and furniture were comfortable. There were some annoying room noises such as a small minibar fridge that rattled off and on thru the night. The bathroom was very nice however, though it sometimes took 30 seconds or longer to get hot water flowing from the showerhead. However, these are quibbles: staff were solicitous, breakfast excellent and elevators fast. Great locale too.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">501 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>
Monaco San Francisco, a Kimpton Hotel		2013-10-06	4	The hotel and front desk were very helpful and friendly. Only issue was we had asked our air to remain on several times and every time we returned to our room the air was shut off. I even taped a note on the air control unit.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">501 Geary Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94102</span>

Hotel Zetta San Francisco		2014-07-21	4	The room was really nice & clean! We got there at around noon, hoping to get into our room a bit early, but had to wait till 3pm - not their fault but would have nice if they had accommodated us. Parking was ridiculously expensive at the hotel & around - we spent as much in parking as the rental! Lots if public transportation options close by.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">55 5th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>
Hotel Zetta San Francisco		2014-07-08	4	We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Zetta. It is a quiet and comfortable small hotel directly adjacent to the Westfield San Francisco Centre. It’s a nice 7 minute walk (0.3 miles) from Union Square and all the downtown activity. The street the hotel is on, 5th Street, is not a particularly fancy street so there isn’t much of a view to be had other than a building and liquor store across the street. There are 116 rooms and the property is still very new and clean since opening a little over a year ago (the result of the renovation of an older hotel). We had a room with two queen beds on the 5th floor, which was 415 square feet – a nice size compared to many other rooms in San Francisco (though the single bed rooms are smaller). The gym is located on the 4th floor and has pretty new, hi-tech equipment. You need your room key to access it. Free, new earbuds are provided to those who want to use them while working out. The valet service is convenient, though be aware that everything is taxed and what is advertised as a $50.00 a day parking fee is actually $57.00 per day due to a parking tax. The décor is modern-tech and quirky. This is definitely geared more toward a younger, hip crowd. The bathroom amenities are large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel; nothing you can take home :( I have stayed at other 4-5 star hotels in the area that I liked better and were less expensive, but we had a good stay here and if the price were right, we would stay again. The Powell & Market Cable Car Turnaround is right around the corner, but be prepared for a long wait to get on here if you wish to ride. The line was very long every time we passed by. Also, the hotel does a pre-authorization to your credit card upon check-in, which I was not informed about so it caused some confusion once we got home and I saw a $200.00 charge pending from Hotel Zetta.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">55 5th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>

Hotel Zetta San Francisco		2014-05-27	4	Staff were very helpful and friendly, we liked the added games room. Only downside i would say was the fancy coffee maker, as you only got two pods per day, and there was no kettle, apart from that we couldn't really fault it.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">55 5th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">94103</span>
